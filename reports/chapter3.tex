We have seen in the previous chapter, how the change in sign of planetary vorticity at the equator, coupled with the conservation of potential vorticity leads us to expect symmetric instability to be excited in cross-equatorial western boundary currents. In this chapter we will explore results from high resolution idealised numerical models of a surface intensified western boundary current, similar to the North Brazil Current. The content of this chapter is based on a paper published in the Journal of Physical Oceanography which I took a leading role on authoring \citep{Goldsworth2021a}.

\section{The North Brazil Current and its rings}
The tropical Atlantic contains two major western boundary current systems. In the surface there is the North Brazil Current and its rings which flow northward across the equator, and below it sits the southwards flowing Deep Western Boundary Current. The flows considered in this chapter are dynamically similar to the North Brazil Current; however, the conclusions of this work are expected to apply to cross-equatorial flows in upper-ocean western boundary currents more generally.

The North Brazil Current follows the coast of Brazil from around 10$^\circ$S -- 15$^\circ$S to 4$^\circ$N -- 8$^\circ$N. Here, it retroreflects and breaks up into anticyclonic eddies called the North Brazil Current rings, which continue northward to the Caribbean~\citep{Talley2011h, Fonseca2004}. The latitude of retroflection of the North Brazil Current is set by the position of the intertropical convergence zone. The position of this region is known to depend strongly upon AMOC heat transports and vary seasonally. At the intertropical convergence zone there is a zero in the wind stress curl, and this forces the North Brazil Current to cross the equator. If the wind stress curl was perfectly symmetric about the equator, there would  be no gyre contribution to inter-hemispheric water exchange, just sufficient mass exchange to close the AMOC.

Both the North Brazil current and its rings are important pathways in the northward transport of Southern Hemisphere waters, and form an important component of the AMOC~\citep{Bower2019}. The current has an annual mean transport of around 32 Sv (1 Sv$\equiv 10^{6}$ m$^3$\,s$^{-1}$) in the upper 600 m of the ocean, with typical peak velocities of around 80 cm\,s$^{-1}$ and a width of approximately 100 km~\citep{Johns1998, Schott1993}. At the equator there is a breakdown in geostrophy due to the vanishing of the Coriolis parameter; however, at latitude 1$^\circ$ either side of the equator the current is geostrophically balanced to leading order, while the rings are in cyclogeostrophic balance~\citep{viannaSeasonalInterannualStudy2003, Castelao2011}.

The change in sign of the locally vertical component of planetary vorticity at the equator is an important constraint on the way in which water is able to cross from one hemisphere to the other. The potential vorticity of a fluid parcel is materially conserved in the absence of mechanical and buoyancy forcing, and neglecting non-linearities in the equation of state. Waters starting in the Southern Hemisphere typically have negative PV as a result of the vertical component of their planetary vorticity. Close to the equator, the planetary vorticity varies approximately linearly with latitude --- the $\beta$-plane approximation. As Southern Hemisphere waters flow northward across the equator, their planetary vorticity increases and so, to conserve PV, the flow generates anti-cyclonic relative vorticity. \citet{Killworth1991} shows that this requirement to conserve PV inhibits the penetration of fluid from one hemisphere to another, further than a few Rossby deformation radii.

In a numerical model of cross-equatorial flow,~\citet{Edwards1998I} find an anti-cyclonic eddy field is generated at the equator. They show that this field is responsible for advecting PV, of the opposite sign to the planetary vorticity, into a viscous boundary layer where it can be dissipated. This provides a mechanism for the modification of PV, whose conservation would otherwise inhibit cross-equatorial flow. The eddy field is observed in other models of cross-equatorial flow~\citep[e.g.][]{Jochum2003, Goes2009}. In a follow-up study,~\citet{Edwards1998II} show that the eddy field is generated by barotropic instability, and is enhanced as the Rossby deformation radius is maximal at the equator. It has been proposed this mechanism is behind the generation of the North Brazil Current rings~\citep{Jochum2003}. The North Brazil Current, however, is a surface current and so viscous boundary layers can play only a limited role, if any, in the modification of PV. As such, turbulent processes in the current's interior are more likely to be of importance. These turbulent processes are of particular interest as they may lead to a short-circuiting of the AMOC through enhanced diapycnal mixing. Symmetric instability is one turbulent process that may be capable of modifying the PV in cross-equatorial flows.

\section{Two-dimensional numerical models}
The linear stability analysis of section~\ref{subsec:NBClsa} makes predictions of the growth rate of viscous symmetric instability in a meridionally symmetric, parallel shear flow situated at approximately 4$^\circ$N. We will now consider a two-dimensional numerical model of a similar flow, but with vertical shear, variable stratification and finite depth. The two-dimensional nature of the flow will be retained, via the imposition of a periodic meridional boundary condition on a domain one grid cell thick. This means there is no $\beta$-effect and that equatorially enhanced barotropic instability will not occur~\citep{Edwards1998I,Edwards1998II}.

\subsection{Methods}
\label{subsec:2DMethods}
The numerical simulations are performed using the MITgcm model~\citep{Marshall1997}. The model domain consists of a channel 400 km wide in the zonal direction and periodic in the meridional direction. The horizontal resolution is 2 km. In the vertical there are 160 depth levels, varying in size from 6.25 m at the surface to 25 m at the bottom, giving a total depth of 1,500 m.

Simulations are run on an $f$-plane, with $f = 1.01 \times 10 ^{-5}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a latitude of $4^\circ$N, with the non-traditional component of the Coriolis force included also, taking a value of $F_{NT} = 1.45 \times 10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$. A control integration is run in which the non-traditional component of the Coriolis force is neglected. A further set of integrations at $40^\circ$N and $0^\circ$N, both with and without the non-traditional component of the Coriolis force, are performed. For the integration at $40^\circ$N, $f = 9.35 \times 10^{-5} $ s$^{-1}$ and $F_{NT} = 1.11 \times 10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$; at $0^\circ$N, $f = 0$ s$^{-1}$ and $F_{NT} = 1.45 \times 10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$. In all cases, no qualitative difference between integrations with and without the complete Coriolis force is found; this finding is unsurprising given the results presented in section~\ref{sec:DrasticSI}.

Closure of the momentum equations in the horizontal is provided by an adaptive biharmonic Smagorinsky viscosity. This is chosen to minimize damping at the  length-scales of interest~\citep{Smagorinsky1963, Griffies2000}, with the choice inspired by its successful use in~\citet{Brannigan2016} which attempts to resolve similar sub-mesoscale processes. A Laplacian vertical viscosity, $A_r$, is used and set to a constant value of $4 \times 10^{-4}$ m$^2$\,s$^{-1}$ for all integrations, apart from a viscous integration for which a value of $6 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^2$\,s$^{-1}$ is used. The standard value is chosen to ensure the vertical structure of the symmetric instability can be adequately resolved by the model grid.

A linear equation of state is employed:
\begin{equation}
    \rho = \rho_{0} \big(1 - \alpha_T (T - T_0 )\big) \, ,
    \label{eq:EOS}
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{0}$ is the background density, $T$ is temperature, $T_0$ is a reference temperature, and $\alpha_T$ is the thermal expansion coefficient. The absence of salinity means that changes in density are modulated solely by changes in temperature. The value of $\rho_{0}$ is set to 1023.35 kg$\,$m$^{-3}$, $\alpha_T$  set to $2 \times 10^{-4}$ K$^{-1}$, and $T_0$ set to $30^{\circ}$C. The linear equation of state is used to avoid the complexities added by non-linear effects. The diffusivity of temperature is set to $1 \times 10^{-5}$ m$^2$\,s$^{-1}$. A second order-moment Prather advection scheme with a flux limiter is used~\citep{Prather1986}. The initial density profile is based on observations taken by an Argo float in the tropical Atlantic~\citep{Argo2019}. The neutral density profile and float trajectory is shown in figure~\ref{fig:InitialStratification}, with the temperature profile in the model chosen to match the density profile of the aggregated observations.

The initial velocity profile is based on that of the surface intensified Bickley jet. This can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
    V(x, z) = V_0 \Bigg( 1 - \tanh[2](\frac{x - x_{mid}}{\delta_b})\Bigg) \frac{z + H}{H} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $z$ is the vertical coordinate which becomes increasingly negative below the surface, and $H$ is the absolute value of the depth. The jet parameters are set as follows: $V_0 = 1$ m\,s$^{-1}$, $x_{mid} = 40$ km, $\delta_b = 30$ km, $H = 1,500$ m. The profile is shown in figure~\ref{fig:SurfIntBickleyJet}b. To test the sensitivity of the model to the jet's position, two control simulations are also run with $x_{mid}$ set to either 20 km or 80 km: the resulting instability shows no qualitative dependence on the jet's position. The jet parameters are chosen to be similar to those observed in the North Brazil Current by~\citet{Johns1998}. However, it should be noted that the jet described in this work is more intense ($V_{max} \sim 1$ m\,s$^{-1}$ rather than $\sim 0.9$ m\,s$^{-1}$), has less vertical shear ($\partial_z V \sim 6.6\times 10^{-4}$ m$^{-1}$\,s$^{-1}$ rather than $\sim 3.5 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^{-1}$\,s$^{-1}$), and is deeper ($H\sim 1,500$ m rather than $\sim 800$ m) than that observed by~\citet{Johns1998}, which puts some limitations on the direct applicability of the results presented here to the North Brazil Current. The most significant differences occur in the shear and depth. The depth is chosen to be large, to prevent the bottom boundary layer from having too strong an influence on the evolution of any instabilities.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics{../figures/BickleyJet.pdf}
    \caption{Velocity structure of the surface intensified Bickley jet with $V_0 = 1$ m$\,$s$^{-1}$,  $x_{mid} = 40$ km, $\delta_b = 30$ km and $H = 1500$ m. Get rid of panel (a).}
    \label{fig:SurfIntBickleyJet}
\end{figure}

In the 4$^\circ$N integrations, the jet prescribed is symmetrically unstable from the outset. This allows us to explore the evolution of unforced symmetric instability in a `plausible' western boundary current. In a two-dimensional numerical model, the meridional advection of Southern Hemisphere waters with negative potential vorticity into the domain is not possible. As such we must initialise the numerical integration with waters of negative potential vorticity already in place.

At the surface boundary a rigid lid condition is used. The lateral boundary conditions at the eastern and western edges of the domain are set to no-slip. At the bottom, a free-slip boundary condition is used. The sensitivity of the simulations to the choice of boundary condition has been tested by performing model integrations with free-surface, free-slip lateral, and no-slip bottom boundary conditions: in each case, no qualitative differences in the resulting instability are observed.

\subsection{Results and their relation to the linear stability analysis}
Snapshots of potential vorticity at a range of times from the standard two-dimensional numerical integration are shown in figure~\ref{fig:2DPVSnapshotsStandard}. After around 5 days the potential vorticity distribution begins to change (not shown) and after two weeks the excitement of the instability is clearly visible. The timescale (the inverse of the growth rate, $\flatfrac{1}{\sigma}$) predicted by the linear stability analysis is $\sim 2$ days, which is of the right order of magnitude for what is seen here. In the leftmost panel (c), we see how the potential vorticity in the initially unstable region has been modified and set to a state of marginal stability --- i.e. $Q = 0$. This modification of potential vorticity is driven by the overturning cells, which were predicted by the linear stability analysis. Due to the along stream symmetry, we can rearrange the equation for the conservation of potential vorticity to give
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:PVEvolution}
    \pdv{Q}{t} = \pdv{\psi}{z}\pdv{Q}{x} - \pdv{\psi}{x}\pdv{Q}{z} \, ,%- \div{(\grad{b} \cross \mathbf{G})}\, ,
\end{equation}
which makes the link between the unstable overturning generated by the instability and the redistribution of potential vorticity explicit\footnotemark.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{../figures/2d_pv.pdf}
    \caption{Snapshots of potential vorticity over time in the standard (no-slip) two-dimensional model. Potential vorticity is shown as a function of depth and longitude. An animated version of this figure is available in the supplementary materials.}
    \label{fig:2DPVSnapshotsStandard}
\end{figure}

\footnotetext{This equation neglects the frictional dissipation of potential vorticity; however, this contribution is generally much smaller than the contribution from advection.}

Figure~\ref{fig:2DStandardOverturningStreamfunction} shows the zonal overturning stream-function from the standard two-dimensional numerical integration. We see structures similar to those predicted by the linear stability analysis (c.f. figure~\ref{fig:2DStructure}). The vertical Fourier transform of the stream-function is taken at two weeks. At the longitude of the absolute vorticity minimum, there is a maximum in the power spectrum with a vertical wavelength of 100 m. This estimate of the size of the overturning cells is remarkably similar to the prediction of 105 m made by the linear stability analysis. We would expect fairly close agreement as the parameters used in the linear stability analysis are based on the jet used to initialise the model.

    \includegraphics{../figures/2d_overturning.pdf}
    \caption{Snapshots of the zonal overturning stream-function generated by symmetric instability in the standard (no-slip) two-dimensional model. The five-day moving average of the stream-function is taken to mask the effects of internal waves.}
    \label{fig:2DStandardOverturningStreamfunction}
\end{figure}

The resolution of the model means that secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities that typically accompany the excitement of symmetric instability are absent. The resolution and aspect ratio of the model may also be insufficient to fully resolve the dynamics of the symmetric instability if the overturning cells become aligned with isopycnals as expected~\citep{Bachman2014}. Furthermore, the use of an artificially high vertical viscosity, to ensure numerical stability,  means the growth rate of the instability is suppressed and its vertical extent exaggerated. Although symmetric instability may look different in the ocean, the conclusion that symmetric instability is efficient at eliminating anomalous potential vorticity within a few degrees of the equator will not change --- if anything the process will be more efficient.

The linear stability analysis suggests that by setting the viscosity to be sufficiently high, the unstable motions can be suppressed. Integrations with a high viscosity of $6 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^2$\,s$^{-1}$ are performed and, indeed, no instability develops. The linear stability analysis also predicts no instability if the experiment is performed at a sufficiently high latitude, or at the equator: model integrations at 40$^{\circ}$N and 0$^{\circ}$N verify this is indeed the case (not shown).

\section{Three-dimensional numerical models}
Although a useful tool in understanding the processes at play in cross-equatorial flows, two-dimensional numerical models fail to capture key dynamics of the flows. Perhaps the most important missing pieces are the $\beta$-effect and meridionally asymmetric motions, both of which are suppressed by the imposition of along-stream symmetry. It is the variation and change in sign of planetary vorticity at the equator which we suspect will lead to symmetric instability. Furthermore,~\citet{Edwards1998II} show that barotropic eddies are an important and robust feature of cross-equatorial flows. These motions cannot form if there is no meridional variation in the flow. To fully understand what is going on in the ocean, we must relax the requirement of along-stream symmetry and turn to three-dimensional numerical models. This section describes an idealised three-dimensional model of the tropical Atlantic based on the two-dimensional model discussed previously.

\subsection{Methods}
The three-dimensional model uses a configuration based on the two-dimensional model described in section~\ref{subsec:2DMethods}. The differences are outlined below.

The horizontal domain is 816 km in the zonal and 2,688 km in the meridional direction. The horizontal resolution is 2 km. The southernmost boundary is located 512 km south of the equator and the northern boundary 2,176 km to the north. The velocity at the northern and southern boundaries is prescribed and takes the form of the surface intensified Bickley jet, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:SurfIntBickleyJet}b. The zonal velocity is initially set to zero and the meridional velocity to the same  surface intensified Bickley jet prescribed at the northern and southern boundaries. As in the models previously discussed, this means the initial potential vorticity configuration is unstable to symmetric instabilities. In the Northern Hemisphere, within around 3 weeks, the majority of the negative potential vorticity initially present has been neutralized by an initial flurry of symmetric instability (in the standard viscosity runs). After this time the largest source of negative potential vorticity in the Northern Hemisphere is waters advected across the equator --- this can be seen clearly in the animations included in the supplementary materials.

To absorb any incoming waves or eddies, there exists a sponge region within the  domain, which relaxes the velocity to the Bickley jet profile prescribed at the northern and southern boundaries. The sponges stretch from 350 km south of the northern and 40 km north of the southern edges of the domain. The inverse relaxation timescale in these sponge regions varies according to a $\tanh$ function from 0 s$^{-1}$ in the interior of the sponge to $2 \times 10^{-5}$ s$^{-1}$ at the open boundary. The sponge regions are cropped from all figures.

Unlike in the two-dimensional model integrations, the three-dimensional integrations evolve in qualitatively different ways depending on whether a no-slip or free-slip lateral boundary condition is imposed. The no-slip boundary condition is taken to be the standard choice, although results from free-slip integrations are also presented. A time step of 144 seconds is used for the no-slip model and 72 seconds for the free-slip model, which has a higher Reynolds number.

Integrations are performed with either a standard vertical viscosity of $4\times 10^{-4}$ m$^2$\,s$^{-1}$, or a high vertical viscosity of $1\times 10^{-2}$ m$^2$\,s$^{-1}$. The high viscosity is larger than the value of $6\times 10^{-3}$ m$^2$\,s$^{-1}$ used in the two-dimensional high viscosity runs. This is because the former value was insufficient to shut down the excitement of symmetric instability at high latitudes. The larger value is still not strong enough to completely shut down the excitement of symmetric instability; however, it does appreciably suppress the growth of the instability.

The $\beta$-plane approximation is made, which gives a linear latitudinal variation of planetary vorticity of $2.3\times 10^{-11}$ s$^{-1}$\,m$^{-1}$. The non-traditional component of the Coriolis force is also included by setting $F_{NT}$ to a constant value\footnotemark~of $1.5\times 10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$.

\footnotetext{Strictly speaking, in a spherical geometry we would expect $F_{NT} = 2\Omega \cos\theta$ where $\theta$ is the latitude. At the equator, the variation in $F_{NT}$ with latitude is minimal, and over the domain considered here, $F_{NT}$ is constant to 2 significant figures. As such it was decided to ignore the meridional variation in $F_{NT}$ and make the ``non-traditional $f$-plane'' approximation.}

The same thermodynamic scheme and initial stratification is used as in the two-dimensional numerical models previously discussed. In much of the following discussion analyses are performed at a depth of 50 m. This depth is chosen as it sits below the model's mixed-layer but is still close to the surface where the excitement of symmetric instability is expected to be most vigorous.

\subsection{Results \& discussion}
\label{subsec:3DResults}
\subsubsection{No-slip lateral boundary conditions}
Figure~\ref{fig:PVStandardNoSlip3D} shows snapshots of the potential vorticity field in the standard three-dimensional no-slip integration, at a depth of 50 m. Close to the equator we see the spinning up of anticyclonic eddies of up to 200 km in diameter. The eddies are dynamically similar to those seen in other studies of cross-equatorial flow and are a result of barotropic instability~\citep[e.g.][]{Edwards1998I, Edwards1998II, Jochum2003, Goes2009}. Between around 250 km and 1000 km north of the equator, smaller scale features within the eddies are visible: these arise from the excitement of symmetric instability.

There is an interesting interplay between the barotropic and symmetric instabilities. We see in the Northern Hemisphere of figure~\ref{fig:PVStandardNoSlip3D}a that the eddy with anticyclonic potential vorticity initially penetrates a few hundred kilometres, before it begins to retroflect. Within around a week the potential vorticity within the eddy has been reduced and it is able to propagate further northwards (see figure~\ref{fig:PVStandardNoSlip3D}b). If we look to the sub-mesoscale, we see  features with large spatial potential vorticity gradients over short distances. This is a result of the excitement of  symmetric instability which acts to redistribute potential vorticity within the eddy. By reducing its potential vorticity the eddy is able to propagate even further north (figure~\ref{fig:PVStandardNoSlip3D}c). As the eddy moves further northwards the growth rate of symmetric instability increases and any remaining regions of negative potential vorticity become increasingly unstable. We are left with an anticyclonic eddy with approximately neutral potential vorticity, corresponding to a state of marginal stability. Figure~\ref{fig:EddyRelativeAndAbsoluteVorticity} shows a comparison of the relative and potential vorticity of an eddy which has undergone this process. We see that close to the equator regions of negative potential vorticity correspond to regions of negative relative vorticity. In a region from around 500 km to 800 km north of the equator the relationship is less clear. North of this region, the planetary vorticity is larger than the relative vorticity and contributes the most to the absolute vorticity. From figure~\ref{fig:PVStandardNoSlip3D} (and more clearly its animated counterpart, figure~\ref{fig:PVStandardNoSlip3D}S, in the supplementary materials), the excitement of symmetric instability is what seems to be driving the transition from one regime to the other. South of a distance 500 km north of the equator, the relative vorticity is negative. Between 500 km and 800 km north, symmetric instability is excited. Waters leaving this region then have approximately neutral potential vorticity as a result of the excitement of symmetric\ instability.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{../figures/PV3DSnapshotStandardNoSlip.pdf}
    \caption{Snapshots of potential vorticity at 50 m depth for the standard (no-slip) three-dimensional model.}
    \label{fig:PVStandardNoSlip3D}
\end{figure}

The offset of this symmetrically unstable region from the equator can be understood in terms of the growth rate of the instability.

Firstly, in the inviscid limit the square of the growth rate of symmetric instability is proportional to $f(f + \xi)$, where $\xi$ is the relative vorticity of the fluid. To first order (and in the absence of symmetric instability), changes in the planetary vorticity are approximately balanced by the relative vorticity, meaning $(f + \xi)$ is approximately constant along flow-lines. This gives a growth rate that grows linearly with $f$ and hence latitude. Close to the equator where $f$ is small, the growth rate will be so small that other processes will dominate over symmetric instability. When a fluid parcel is advected further north, its growth rate will increase until the excitement of symmetric instability becomes apparent. At this point, symmetric instability begins to modify the potential vorticity and absolute vorticity, removing anomalous vorticity from the flow. At higher latitudes still, the source of negative potential vorticity that the instability feeds off has been largely depleted. This means we only see symmetric instability occurring within a finite latitude range.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{../figures/VorticityComparison.pdf}
    \caption{Instantaneous relate and potential vorticity after 35 days at 50 m depth in the same region north of the equator using field from the standard (no-slip) three-dimensional models.}
    \label{fig:EddyRelativeAndAbsoluteVorticity}
\end{figure}

Secondly, the fluid takes a finite time to show signs of symmetric instability. During this time the fluid will have been advected northwards away from the equator. This distance, $d$, can be crudely estimated by $d = V \tau$, where $V$ is a typical velocity of the fluid and $\tau$ is the timescale it takes for symmetric instability to become apparent in the flow. Taking $V\sim 80$ cm\,s$^{-1}$ and $\tau \sim 4$ days gives $d \sim 300$ km. From this, we shouldn't expect the instability to be well-developed either at or close to the equator.


\begin{figure} 
    \centering
    \includegraphics{../figures/PV3DSliceSnapshotStandardNoSlip.pdf}
    \caption{Snapshots of potential vorticity as a function of depth and longitude at 750 km  North of the equator in the standard no-slip three-dimensional model.}
    \label{fig:PVatFixedLatStandardNoSlip3D}
\end{figure}

It is interesting to look at snapshots of the potential vorticity from the three-dimensional model at a fixed latitude, to track how the symmetric instability evolves over time, akin to what is shown in figure~\ref{fig:2DPVSnapshotsStandard}. This is done in figure~\ref{fig:PVatFixedLatStandardNoSlip3D}. Initially the instability behaves similarly to the two-dimensional case, although the features are slightly distorted by `noise' from passing eddies and internal waves. In more realistic model set-ups, and in the ocean, it may not be possible to see the initial, clean evolution of symmetric instability. As such, other diagnostic quantities may be required to detect its excitement.

As with the two-dimensional numerical model, the coarseness of the grid and use of an enhanced eddy viscosity are key limitations of the three-dimensional integrations presented here. The grid is unable to resolve fully the evolution of secondary instabilities, may not correctly resolve motion along slanted isopycnals, will suppress the growth rate, and will enhance the vertical extent of the instability. As before, it seems unlikely that this will change the fact that symmetric instability is efficient at neutralising anomalous potential vorticity in waters that have crossed the equator, especially due to the larger growth rate we expect to see when a lower, more realistic viscosity is used.

The potential vorticity evolution of the viscous no-slip integration is shown in figure~\ref{fig:PV3DSnapshotViscousNoSlip}. The results appear qualitatively similar to those of~\citet{Edwards1998I} whose model does not permit symmetric instability. In this model, lateral friction is leading to dissipation of potential vorticity, which is not as dominant in the standard no-slip integration. At some latitudes, sub-mesoscale patterns are starting to become apparent, particularly within the anticyclonic eddies. Figure~\ref{fig:PVatFixedLatForViscous3D} shows how the potential vorticity varies with depth. Immediately clear is the presence of symmetric instability like features, suggesting the high viscosity has only partially suppressed symmetric instability. Note how the vertical length scale of the disturbance is larger in this integration than in the standard no-slip one. This  can be understood with reference to figure~\ref{fig:DispersionRelation} --- higher viscosities lead to larger vertical length scales.

    \label{fig:PVatFixedLatForViscous3D}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Free-slip lateral boundary conditions}
The behaviour of the three-dimensional model under no-slip and free-slip lateral boundary conditions is qualitatively different. The main difference is the behaviour of the barotropic eddies. The sensitivity to the choice of lateral boundary condition is not seen in the two-dimensional models as they do not develop these barotropic eddies. The differences can be seen by comparing figures~\ref{fig:PVStandardNoSlip3D} and~\ref{fig:PV3DSnapshotStandardFreeSlip}, and more clearly in their animated counterparts, figures~\ref{fig:PVStandardNoSlip3D}S and~\ref{fig:PV3DSnapshotStandardFreeSlip}S of the supplementary materials. 

\begin{figure} 
    \centering
    \includegraphics{../figures/PV3DSnapshotStandardFreeSlip.pdf}
    \caption{Snapshots of potential vorticity at 50 m depth for the free-slip three-dimensional model.}
    \label{fig:PV3DSnapshotStandardFreeSlip}
\end{figure}

In the free-slip integrations, the eddies grow to be larger, and propagate northwards more quickly, than in the no-slip integrations. They do not retroflect in the same way as before. As they propagate northwards, they entrain waters of negative potential vorticity and elongate, creating a concentrated pool of symmetrically unstable waters. When the eddies do become unstable, the process is much more explosive. This can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:PV3DSnapshotStandardFreeSlip} and its animated counterpart, figure~\ref{fig:PV3DSnapshotStandardFreeSlip}S, in the supplementary materials. As the eddies propagate northwards more quickly, the symmetrically unstable region appears to be shifted northwards. This is because it takes a similar time for symmetric instability to develop, but the eddies have moved further north of the equator during this time.

The potential vorticity evolution from a free-slip viscous integration is shown in figure~\ref{fig:PV3DSnapshotViscousFreeSlip}, reinforcing that, with the noise of symmetric instability removed, the barotropic eddies behave very differently under the two different lateral boundary conditions. This raises the question of what the most appropriate boundary condition is. For the idealised model setup, this is likely the no-slip lateral condition. In a realistic model, given the small aspect ratio of the problem, a no-slip bottom boundary and free-slip lateral boundary condition, along with variable bathymetry might better represent the physics. This is a result of gently sloping ocean bathymetry in the region meaning that the sea floor is better approximated as a bottom boundary, rather than a lateral boundary.

    \label{fig:PV3DSnapshotViscousFreeSlip}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Correlations between relative and potential vorticity}
It is useful to be able to define concretely the latitudes at which symmetric instability is occurring. Thus far, this has been done visually by looking at the regions in which sub-mesoscale patterns begin to form in areas of anticyclonic vorticity. It has been noted that regions in which symmetric instability is occurring mark a transition from a regime in which potential vorticity is dominated by relative vorticity to one in which the planetary vorticity dominates. Figure~\ref{fig:EddyRelativeAndAbsoluteVorticity} suggests it may be possible to identify latitudes at which symmetric instability is occurring by considering correlations between relative vorticity and potential vorticity.

The relative vorticity and potential vorticity are interpolated onto the same grid. The Pearson correlation coefficient, $r$, of the vertical component of relative vorticity and potential vorticity between 21 days and 49 days is calculated for all grid points between the western boundary and 400 km east at 50 m depth for each latitude. The calculation starts at 21 days so that any instability resulting from the initial conditions has died down. How the correlation coefficient varies with latitude is shown in figure~\ref{fig:VorticityCorrelations}, for both the no-slip and free-slip, and standard and viscous, integrations.
In figure~\ref{fig:VorticityCorrelations}, we see that the vertical component of relative vorticity and potential vorticity are very strongly correlated in the Southern Hemisphere. At around 250 km north of the equator, there is an abrupt change in the correlation for the standard no-slip and free-slip integrations. The latitude of the change seems to correspond to the latitude north of which we observe symmetric instability. In the case of the no-slip integration, $r$ reduces to around 0.8, and for the free-slip integration it is reduced even further, to less than 0.6. This makes sense --- in the free-slip experiment the excitement of symmetric instability appears qualitatively more vigorous than in the no-slip experiment.

\begin{figure} 
    \centering
    \includegraphics{../figures/VorticityCorrelation.pdf}
    \caption{Correlations between relative and potential vorticity as a function of latitude. Shown for integrations with a standard (solid lines) or enhanced (dotted lines) vertical viscosity, and for both no-slip (black lines) and free-slip (grey lines) models.}
    \label{fig:VorticityCorrelations}
\end{figure}

We see a much smaller and more gradual drop in the correlation for the viscous integrations, and the decrease in $r$ appears to begin at much higher latitudes --- around 600 km for the free-slip and 1,000 km for the no-slip integration. This is consistent with what we see in the models: at low latitudes we see little evidence of symmetric instability; however, its effects become apparent at higher latitudes.

We can understand the change in correlations in terms of the potential vorticity of a meridional flow, given by
\begin{equation}
    Q \approx \bigg(N^2 f - M^2 \pdv{V}{z} \bigg) + N^2 \xi
\end{equation}
where $N^2$ and $M^2$ are the vertical and horizontal buoyancy gradients, respectively. In the absence of symmetric instability, at a given latitude, one would expect there to be a strong correlation between $Q$ and $\xi$. If $N^2$ and $f$ are approximately constant, and $M^2$ and $\partial_z V$ are small, then the bracketed term of the above equation will be approximately constant and a linear relationship between $Q$ and $\xi$ will exist. When symmetric instability is excited, localized vortex stretching and changes in the vertical shear cause a breakdown of this linear relationship. As such, one would expect the correlation between the vertical component of relative vorticity and potential vorticity to be much lower. The fact that the correlation changes only slightly in the viscous runs, which exhibit barotropic eddies but suppressed excitement of symmetric instability, suggests that the changes in the linear relationship are the result of symmetric instability.

\subsection{Spectral energy density}
Symmetric instability is a sub-mesoscale instability, suggesting that when it is excited, we would expect to see an increase in the amount of energy at small length scales.~\citet{Yankovsky2019} find that within their models of symmetric instability in Arctic overflows, symmetric instability has a fingerprint in the spatial Fourier transform of the vertical kinetic energy (KE). This technique is used here in an attempt to diagnose symmetric instability.

For the standard three-dimensional no-slip integration, the quantity $\flatfrac{w^2}{2}$ is calculated at a depth of 50 m from the western boundary to 200 km east, and from 250 km to 750 km north. The power spectrum is taken along the zonal dimension and the meridional mean taken. This is plotted at one-week intervals in figure~\ref{fig:SpectralEnergyDensity}a. The same is done for the three-dimensional viscous no-slip integration in figure~\ref{fig:SpectralEnergyDensity}b. The same procedure is performed for the single latitude of the two-dimensional standard and viscous no-slip models and the results shown in figures~\ref{fig:SpectralEnergyDensity}c and~\ref{fig:SpectralEnergyDensity}d respectively.

\begin{figure} 
    \centering
    \includegraphics{../figures/PowerSpectra.pdf}
    \caption{Spectral distribution of vertical kinetic energy for the (a) standard three-dimensional, (b) viscous three-dimensional, (c) standard two-dimensional, and (d) viscous two-dimensional models. Note that the vertical viscosity used in the viscous two-dimensional integration is $6 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^2\,$s$^{-1}$ compared to $10^{-2}$ m$^2\,$s$^{-1}$ for its three-dimensional counterpart. Darkening line colour corresponds to later model times.}
    \label{fig:SpectralEnergyDensity}
\end{figure}

In each of the panels a, b \& c of figure~\ref{fig:SpectralEnergyDensity}, we see a flattening of the power spectra over time. This corresponds to the development of vertical motions with a structure that varies over small length scales. In the case of the standard three-dimensional model, within around four weeks the power spectrum reaches an equilibrium.

In the viscous three-dimensional model it takes around three weeks for the flattening to take place. This is due to the increased vertical viscosity suppressing the growth rate. Interestingly, however, we do still see the flattening effect of symmetric instability at later times, as the viscosity is not sufficient to completely inhibit its development.

In the standard two-dimensional model, after an initial flattening of the spectra there is a subsequent steepening from four weeks onwards. After four weeks, the two-dimensional model has used up most of its finite reserves of negative potential vorticity which fuel the symmetric instability. This means that there is no process to sustain the small scale vertical motions and they begin to die away. This is in contrast to the three-dimensional model in which the supply of negative potential vorticity is constantly being replenished by the advection of Southern Hemisphere waters across the equator. As the two-dimensional model is not capable of producing barotropic eddies, we can be fairly certain that the changes in the power spectrum are not related to them. The increased variability relative to the three-dimensional models is due to the removal of the meridional averaging step.

In the viscous two-dimensional model, in contrast to its three-dimensional counterpart, we see no flattening at all in the power spectra\footnote{Note that the viscous two-dimensional model uses a viscosity of $6 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^2$\,s$^{-1}$ compared to $10^{-2}$ m$^2$\,s$^{-1}$ for the viscous three-dimensional model.}. This is because the vertical viscosity is sufficient to completely inhibit symmetric instability in this model. The stationarity of the power spectra allows us to say with some confidence that the flattening seen in the other models is due to the presence of symmetric instability. Indeed, the flattening of power spectra may prove useful for identifying symmetric instability in more complex ocean models and in observations, in which the signature of symmetric instability may otherwise be less obvious.

The power spectra appear to show a lot of power concentrated at the grid-scale. Inspection of the vertical velocities in the region suggest this is not the result of grid-scale noise, but rather physical flow structures. Note also that the axes in figure~\ref{fig:SpectralEnergyDensity} are logarithmic.

\subsection{Transformation of water masses}
\label{subsubsec:WaterMassTransformation}
Symmetric instability leads to the generation of small-scale overturning cells. Such cells may be expected to lead to the mixing of waters with different density and contribute to water mass transformation. In the \citet{Walin1982} water mass transformation framework, the rate of formation of water between two isopycnal surfaces $\rho$ and $\rho + \Delta \rho$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    \mathscr{F} = \pdv{\mathcal{V}}{t} + \Delta \psi = G(\rho) - G(\rho + \Delta \rho)
    \label{eq:WallinFormation}
\end{equation}
where $\mathscr{F}$ is the rate of formation of fluid between the isopycnals, $\mathcal{V}$ is the volume bounded by the isopycnals, $\Delta \psi$ is the net volume flux out of the region, and $G(\rho)$ is the diapycnal volume flux across the $\rho$-isopycnal --- also known as the water mass transformation. By convention a positive value of $G$ corresponds to a flux from lighter to denser waters. These quantities are shown diagrammatically in figure~\ref{fig:WaterMassFormationSketch}.

\begin{figure} 
    \centering
    \includegraphics{../figures/WaterMassFormationSketch.pdf}
    \caption{Sketch of the processes contributing to water mass formation in the Walin framework. Adapted from~\citet{Williams2011}.}
    \label{fig:WaterMassFormationSketch}
\end{figure}

The water mass formation is calculated for density classes of $\sigma < 23.45$, $23.45 \leq \sigma < 26.50$~and $\sigma \geq 26.50$, where $\sigma = \rho - 1000$ kg\,m$^{-3}$. Physically these correspond to a surface layer, the pycnocline and deep ocean, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:InitialStratification} alongside the initial stratification profile. The formation is diagnosed in latitude bands with boundaries at -500 km, -250 km, 0 km, 250 km, 750 km, and 1500 km for both the standard no-slip  and viscous no-slip integrations. There is a large amount of temporal variability in the formation and so it is hard to discern any trends in the volumes of the chosen density layers. To remove this variability, the rolling average is taken over 25 output time-steps (corresponding to approximately 2.9 days), and is shown in figure~\ref{fig:WaterMassFormation}. By cumulatively integrating the time series, it is easier to identify long term trends in formation. Figure~\ref{fig:CumulativeWaterMassFormation} shows the cumulative formation in each of the density classes and latitude bands.

\end{figure}

South of 250 km, there are no significant changes in the volume of the surface layer for either the standard or viscous runs. North of this latitude, in both models we see a trend corresponding to a decrease in volume. In the 250 km to 750 km band, the trend is most significant in the standard run; however, in the 750 km to 1,500 km band the volume change of the viscous run is more prominent. These latitudes are where we see the excitement of symmetric instability, which is mixing dense waters from below the surface layer with waters within it. This leads to a reduction of waters in the lightest density class.

The growth rate of symmetric instability in the extra viscous integration is suppressed at lower latitudes. At higher latitudes, where the instability has had longer to develop, its effects can still be seen in the depletion of the mixed layer. The formation is stronger for the viscous integration than the standard in the northernmost latitude band. The supply of negative potential vorticity which fuels the instability is lower in the case of the standard integration as it has been neutralized further south. This reduced supply is what causes lower formation in the standard integration than in the viscous integration.

For the pycnocline, in the two northernmost latitude bands, we see differences in the formation between the standard and viscous integrations. In the standard integration, we see both a net formation and depletion of pycnocline waters depending on the time-scales we look at. For the viscous integration, we see a similar time-varying formation-depletion pattern within the pycnocline, however, at later times in the northernmost band, we also see a trend of net depletion of pycnocline waters. Looking to the deep ocean (in the same latitude band), we see a net formation of deep waters, similar in magnitude to the depletion we see in the surface layer and pycnocline waters. This can be understood in terms of the dependence of the vertical scale of symmetric instability on the viscosity. Figure~\ref{fig:DispersionRelation} suggests that as we increase the viscosity the size of the overturning cells will increase. For the viscosity used in the viscous integration we might expect a $\lambda \sim 10^2$ m. This can lead to overturning cells able to connect the deep ocean and the surface layer, as seen in figure~\ref{fig:PVatFixedLatForViscous3D}.

The magnitude of the filtered water mass formation is typically small compared to the meridional transport of the modelled current. The maximum formation rate is around 4.8 Sv; however, more generally, symmetric instability is responsible for instantaneous formation rates of no more than 2 Sv. The cumulatively integrated formation for the standard run suggests that the net effect of symmetric instability on water mass transformation is small, with large instantaneous formation rates balancing over time periods of several weeks.

The water mass formation rates calculated here may have limited applicability to the ocean. Here, we have found that the rates are affected by the vertical viscosity used, suggesting different formation rates would be found if a lower viscosity were used.~\citet{Yankovsky2019} find that mixing by symmetric instability is largely adiabatic, with irreversible mixing resulting from secondary shear instabilities. The model grid used here is too coarse to resolve such secondary instabilities, suggesting formation rates may be higher if a finer grid were used. Similarly, the model resolution may prevent the accurate representation of symmetric instability when the overturning cells are oriented along isopycnals. It seems unlikely that this limitation will alter the key finding that symmetric instability is efficient at removing anomalous potential vorticity originating from the opposing hemisphere.


\section{Summary}
Here we saw results from two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical models of a Bickley jet as it crosses the equator. In the two-dimensional models we were able to see the clean evolution of symmetric instability and the generation of stacked overturning cells confined to regions of negative potential vorticity as predicted by the linear stability analyses of section~\ref{sec:ViscousSI} and~\ref{sec:DrasticSI}.

The two-dimensional model neglects the $\beta$-effect and constrains the horizontal motions of the flow. A further degree of realism was added by developing an idealised three-dimensional model of the Tropical Atlantic which incorporates these effects. As the flow evolves in the model, two main classes of instability develop. The first is the spinning up of anticyclonic eddies as the fluid crosses the equator. This is a result of barotropic instability and has been both investigated and observed in the works of~\citet{Edwards1998I, Edwards1998II} and~\citet{Goes2009}. The second instability is identified as symmetric instability for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The characteristic timescale of the instability is of the same order of magnitude as that predicted by linear stability analyses.
    \item The vertical length scale of the overturning cells that develop are consistent with those predicted by linear stability analyses.
    \item The instability is confined to regions of negative potential vorticity with minimal penetration of the instability into regions of positive potential vorticity.
    \item Eddies with strongly negative potential vorticity fuel the excitement of the instability, becoming unstable towards the edge of their cores first, as predicted by linear stability theory.
    \item Water leaving regions of instability have potential vorticity that is neutrally stable to symmetric instability.
    \item The latitude at which the instability occurs is explained well by arguments pertaining to the latitudinal dependence of the growth rate of symmetric instability.
    \item The instability can be suppressed in numerical models via the imposition of a sufficiently high vertical viscosity, as predicted by linear stability theory.
    \item The power spectrum of the vertical kinetic energy in the standard three-dimensional integration is similar to that in its two-dimensional counterpart. The latter unambiguously shows symmetric instability and shows that the change in the spectrum is not the result of barotropic instability. Moreover, the power spectrum of the viscous two-dimensional integration, which displays no signs of symmetric instability also remains stationary, with no flattening occurring.
\end{itemize}

Initially, we believed the excitement of symmetric instability could lead to the transformation of fluids between different water mass classes. An analysis of the water mass formation rates in the surface, pycnocline and deep ocean suggests that the net contribution of symmetric instability to the AMOC's overturning budget is likely to be small. Over short times scales, we see typical transformation rates of $\pm 2$ Sv, but reaching $\pm 4$ Sv at times; however, over longer time scales these transformations seem to average out to a net rate of around $\pm $ Sv between surface and pycnocline waters and $\pm 2$ Sv for deep waters. A key limitation of these water mass transformation calculations ins the viscosity dependence of the overturning cells generated by the instability. In the ocean we expect a lower limit of their vertical extent to be around $15$ m, which would likely alter the formation rates we have calculated in this study. Furthermore, ~\citet{Yankovsky2019} find that the mixing of waters by symmetric instability is largely adiabatic and that secondary shear instabilities are what cause irreversible mixing. Achieving a high enough resolution with the three-dimensional models presented here may be difficult, however, a modified two-dimensional model may prove useful for obtaining better estimates.

Mixing aside, the key finding of this work is that symmetric instability is an efficient mechanism for removing anomalous potential vorticity originating from the opposite hemisphere in cross-equatorial flows. This work has focussed on currents dynamically similar to the North Brazil Current, however, the findings may also apply to other surface intensified cross-equatorial flows, such as the Somali current, an intense, seasonal, wind-driven western boundary current in the Indian Ocean. In the next chapter we will explore the excitement of symmetric instability in the Deep Western Boundary Current, the AMOC's return flow, as it crosses the equator. We will compare what is seen at depth, to what we have seen in this chapter, and explore the overturning cells generated by symmetric instabilities further.
