Eddies are mainly generated in the eastern boundary upwelling systems and in the Brazil Current region. Their westward propagation speed reaches 20~cm/s in equatorial areas, decreasing with latitudes. They present typical amplitudes of 1-5~cm. The largest and most energetic eddies are observed in the equatorial region, especially in the North Brazil Current (NBC) retroflection. The seasonal cycle of the eddy characteristics shows higher amplitudes along the NBC retroflection and the western part of the North Equatorial Countercurrent. A new criterion, based on altimetry data, determines the probability that barotropic instability of mean surface currents is responsible for eddy generation. We find a strong likelihood that the latter plays a key role along the North Equatorial Countercurrent, whereas other mechanisms must be invoked for the NBC region.},

The first is characterized by a dominant vorticity balance between the viscous transport and the advective transport of vorticity.

  abstract = {Abstract Time-dependent downwelling on the Oregon continental shelf is studied with a two-dimensional approximation, that is, spatial variations across shelf and with depth, using the Blumberg-Mellor, finite-difference, stratified, hydrostatic, primitive equation model. The time-dependent response of a coastal ocean at rest to constant, downwelling-favorable wind stress is examined. Topography and stratification representative of the Oregon continental shelf are used for the basic case experiment. The wind stress forces onshore flow in a turbulent surface boundary layer. The compensating flow below the surface layer advects the density field downward and offshore and accelerates an alongshore current in the form of a vertically and horizontally sheared coastal jet. The dominant feature of the response flow field is a downwelling front that moves slowly offshore, leaving behind an inshore region where the density is well mixed. The downwelling front in the density field is concentrated near the bottom, while the front in alongshore velocity extends over the full depth and is nearly vertical, separating weak alongshore velocities inshore from the coastal jet offshore. The front contains strong vertical motion from the surface to the bottom and some recirculation. Much of the offshore flow from the base of the front is characterized by time- and space-dependent fluctuations involving spatially periodic separation and reattachment of the bottom boundary layer and accompanying recirculation cells. This flow has positive potential vorticity and appears to be finite-amplitude slantwise convection resulting from a hydrostatic symmetric instability. Additional experiments show the dependence of the response flow field an the magnitude of the wind stress, the initial stratification, and the shelf topography. Experiments with the vertical turbulent kinematic viscosity and diffusivity parameterized by a different turbulence closure scheme, as a function of a local Rich-ardson number, or as constants show dependence of the response flow field on the choice of turbulence submodel. The occurrence of a well-mixed region inshore and the existence of time- and space-dependent fluctuations associated with slantwise convection in the near-bottom offshore flow appear to be robust features of the two-dimensional downwelling response.},

In this model the driving mechanism is considered to be the easterlies of the southern hemisphere, which do not reverse with season. The contribution from these winds to the Somali Current is maintained throughout the year. However, during the northeast monsoon this northward-flowing current (the east African coastal current) is opposed by the southward-flowing Somali Current, but during the southwest monsoon it is enhanced. The results of some numerical calculations that include physical processes not present in the free jet model are then given. These show that the southern hemisphere easterlies are strong enough to produce a coastal jet 6 to 8 degrees into the northern hemisphere. The physics of this numerically obtained jet are then examined and although the time and length scales are initially baroclinic, the steady jet becomes 'barotropic'. A pseudoanalytic model of this jet is then considered. \textcopyright{} 1979.},

On the {$\beta$}-plane, inertia-gravity waves are excited even in the linear case, though this process is enhanced by nonlinearity. Some energy can go into trapped equatorial wave modes, but for the parameters used in this study, most of the energy initially in the coastal waves is radiated across the equator as inertia-gravity waves.

The water masses belonging to either the cold or warm segment of the global thermohaline cell enter the equatorial region mostly in the form of western boundary currents. The ways they leave it are more varied. The Ekman drift and a geostrophic western boundary current cause the export of near-surface water to the North Atlantic. A part of the southern Salinity Maximum Water, regarded as the shallowest warm water component, is thought to follow this route after experiencing strong property modification in the equatorial upwelling. The underlying South Atlantic Central Water divides into two northward paths, a direct one along the south American continental slope, hardly observed in the data because of an intense variability in the western half of the 7\textdegree 30N line, and a longer one through the eastern basin, taken by water of the equatorial thermostad. There is no trace of such an eastern northward route for the Antarctic Intermediate Water, which is apparently forced northward from the equatorial region through the highly variable circulation of the western basin. The deep western boundary currents carrying southward the upper and middle components of the North Atlantic Deep Water experience a first partial shift to the eastern boundary on crossing the equator. At deeper levels, a part of the lower North Atlantic Deep Water also bifurcates eastward at the equator, but loses its identity through vertical mixing with the Antarctic Bottom Water in the equatorial fracture zones. The newly formed homogeneous bottom water proceeds eastward in the Guinea Basin, with further indication of an overflow into the Angola Basin. Beside the North Atlantic Deep Water, the deep layer of the equatorial region contains a lower-oxygen component, most clearly present between the middle and lower cores of the North Atlantic Deep Water. Previous results on this water are substantiated, namely, an arrival from the southeast, and northwestward crossing of the equator offshore from the deep western boundary current of northern water. A further northward progression of the southern water requires that the equatorial branching of the southward deep boundary current be only intermittent. A comparison of the temperatures along 7\textdegree 30N in 1993 with those obtained at 8\textdegree N during the International Geophysical Year, 36 years before, reveals a net warming of the intermediate and upper deep waters, and cooling of the bottom water. This result is similar to that obtained at 24\textdegree N by other authors, yet there are signs of a southward propagation of a deep cold anomaly in the western basin, which had reached 24\textdegree N in 1992, but not yet 7\textdegree 30N in 1993.},

The characteristic sea surface salinity (SSS) patterns associated with the tropical Atlantic meridional and equatorial interannual modes are extracted from in situ observations, by a statistical analysis performed on the 1980\textendash 2012 period. These SSS signatures of the interannual climatic modes are reproduced in a regional numerical simulation. For each mode, oceanic and/or atmospheric processes driving the SSS signature are identified through a mixed-layer salt budget in the validated model. During a positive meridional mode in spring, a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and related precipitation maximum creates a south-north dipole of positive-negative SSS anomalies around the equator. Western boundary currents strengthen and advect relatively fresh equatorial waters, which creates negative SSS anomalies in the north and south west tropical Atlantic. Meridional and vertical advection create positive SSS anomalies off the Congo River. During a positive equatorial mode in summer, a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone-related rainfall maximum creates a south-north dipole of negative-positive SSS anomalies between the equator and 10\textdegree N. Meridional advection also contributes to the positive SSS anomalies between 5\textdegree N and 10\textdegree N. Vertical advection and diffusion at the mixed-layer base create positive SSS anomalies between 5\textdegree S and the equator. Horizontal advection creates large SSS anomalies in the North Brazil Current retroflection region, negative along the coast and positive further offshore. The SSS signatures of the meridional and equatorial modes described above are well captured by the Soil Moisture\textendash Ocean Salinity satellite during the 2010 and 2012 events.}

An analysis of the energetics of symmetric instability is used to argue that the mixed layer can be at least partially restratified even when some SI modes are absent due to either large horizontal viscosity or coarse model resolution. Linear stability analysis reveals that in the idealized models the amount of restratification can be predicted as a function of the grid spacing and viscosity. The models themselves are used to demonstrate these predictions and reveal three possible outcomes in steady-state: (1) incomplete restratification due to viscosity, (2) incomplete restratification due to resolution, and (3) excessive restratification due to anisotropy of the viscosity. The third outcome occurs even on a high-resolution isotropic grid and in two separate numerical models, and thus appears to be a sort of robust numerical feature. The three outcomes are used to recommend criteria that a successful SI parameterization should satisfy. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.},

  abstract = {A parameterization is proposed for the effects of symmetric instability (SI) on a resolved front. The parameterization is dependent on external forcing by surface buoyancy loss and/or down-front winds, which reduce potential vorticity (PV) and lead to conditions favorable for SI. The parameterization consists of three parts. The first part is a specification for the vertical eddy viscosity, which is derived from a specified ageostrophic circulation resulting from the balance of the Coriolis force and a Reynolds momentum flux (a turbulent Ekman balance), with a previously proposed vertical structure function for the geostrophic shear production. The vertical structure of the eddy viscosity is constructed to extract the mean kinetic energy of the front at a rate consistent with resolved SI. The second part of the parameterization represents a near-surface convective layer whose depth is determined by a previously proposed polynomial equation. The third part of the parameterization represents diffusive tracer mixing through small-scale shear instabilities and SI. The diabatic, vertical component of this diffusivity is set to be proportional to the eddy viscosity using a turbulent Prandtl number, and the along-isopycnal tracer mixing is represented by an anisotropic diffusivity tensor. Preliminary testing of the parameterization using a set of idealized models shows that the extraction of total energy of the front is consistent with that from SI-resolving LES, while yielding mixed layer stratification, momentum, and potential vorticity profiles that compare favorably to those from an extant boundary layer parameterization (Large et al., 1994). The new parameterization is also shown to improve the vertical mixing of a passive tracer in the LES.},

The model uses the horizontally averaged vertical buoyancy gradient and the density of turbulent kinetic energy as variables. Heuristic `mixing-length' arguments lead to a coupled set of parabolic differential equations. A particular form of mechanical forcing is proposed; for certain parameter values the relationship between the buoyancy flux and the buoyancy gradient is non-monotonic and this leads to an instability of equilibria with linear stratification. The instability results in the formation of steps and interfaces in the buoyancy profile. In contrast to previous ones, the model is mathematically well posed and the interfaces have an equilibrium thickness that is much larger than that expected from molecular diffusion.},

  abstract = {The time dependent circulation of the North Brazil Current is studied with three numerical ocean circulation models, which differ by the vertical coordinate used to formulate the primitive equations. The models are driven with the same surface boundary conditions and their horizontal grid-resolution (isotropic, 1/3\textdegree{} at the equator) is in principle fine enough to permit the generation of mesoscale eddies. Our analysis of the mean seasonal currents concludes that the volume transport of the North Brazil Current (NBC) at the equator is principally determined by the strength of the meridional overturning, and suggests that the return path of the global thermohaline circulation is concentrated in the NBC. Models which simulate a realistic overturning at 24\textdegree N of the order of 16-18 Sv also simulate a realistic NBC transport of nearly 35 Sv comparable to estimates deduced from the most recent observations. In all models, the major part of this inflow of warm waters from the South Atlantic recirculates in the zonal equatorial current system, but the models also agree on the existence of a permanent coastal mean flow to the north-west, from the equator into the Carribean Sea, in the form of a continuous current or a succession of eddies. Important differences are found between models in their representation of the eddy field. The reasons invoked are the use of different subgrid-scale parameterisations, and differences in stability of the NBC retroflection loop because of differences in the representation of the effect of bottom friction according to the vertical coordinate that is used. Finally, even if differences noticed between models in the details of the seasonal mean circulation and water mass properties could be explained by differences in the eddy field, nonetheless the major characteristics (mean seasonal currents, volume and heat transports) appears to be at first order driven by the strength of the thermohaline circulation. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a major ocean current system transporting warm surface waters toward the northern Atlantic, has been suggested to exhibit two distinct modes of operation. A collapse from the currently attained strong to the weak mode would have severe impacts on the global climate system and further multi-stable Earth system components. Observations and recently suggested fingerprints of AMOC variability indicate a gradual weakening during the last decades, but estimates of the critical transition point remain uncertain. Here, a robust and general early-warning indicator for forthcoming critical transitions is introduced. Significant early-warning signals are found in eight independent AMOC indices, based on observational sea-surface temperature and salinity data from across the Atlantic Ocean basin. These results reveal spatially consistent empirical evidence that, in the course of the last century, the AMOC may have evolved from relatively stable conditions to a point close to a critical transition.},

  abstract = {We undertake a detailed study of inertial instability of the barotropic Bickley jet and its nonlinear saturation in the 2 layer rotating shallow water (RSW) model on the f-plane and compare it with the classical barotropic and baroclinic instabilities. We start with analytical and numerical investigation of the linear stability problem under hypothesis of strict homogeneity in the along-flow direction ("symmetric instability"). The unstable modes are identified and their parameters are determined. The dependence of the instability on Rossby and Burger numbers of the jet is investigated. The nonlinear development of the instability is then studied with the help of high-resolution well-balanced finite-volume numerical code recently developed for multi-layer RSW, which is initialized with the most unstable mode found from the linear stability analysis. It is shown that symmetric inertial instability is saturated by reorganization of the mean flow, without full homogenization of the anticyclonic region, where the unstable modes reside. We then study along the same lines the fully two-dimensional (2D) problem and compare the results with the one-dimensional analysis. The barotropic instability competes with inertial instability in this case. We show that, for sufficiently strong anticyclonic shears, the inertial instability still has the dominant growth rate in the long-wave sector. The "symmetric" one-dimensional inertial instability turns to be a liming case of the ageostrophic baroclinic instability. Yet, the "asymmetric" inertial instability at small but non-zero wavenumbers has the higher growth rate. We study again the nonlinear development of the most unstable inertial mode and show that homogenization of the region of strong anticyclonic shear of the flow takes place on average. The reorganization of the flow reveals a high degree of complexity, with coherent structure formation and inertia-gravity wave emission, both giving rise to the substantial enhancement of ageostrophic motions. We compare these processes for inertial baroclinic and barotropic instabilities. \textcopyright{} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

Data were obtained during four World Ocean Circulation Experiment cruises, carried out in January-March 1993, January-March 1994, September-October 1995, and April-May 1996. In the upper layer, the continuity of the northwestward flowing North Brazil Current along the American continent toward the Caribbean Sea is confirmed in boreal spring. Furthermore, part of the North Brazil Current also continues northwestward in the subthermocline layer during short periods in boreal spring, contrary to previous estimates. The North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) is present in boreal spring west of 40\textdegree{} W, fed with water of Northern Hemisphere origin only. The southeastward flowing current observed at 3\textdegree{} N-44\textdegree{} W is fed by the North Brazil Current retroflection and by a cyclonic recirculation of the southern edge of the North Equatorial Current. The upper layer of this current, at 3\textdegree{} N-44\textdegree{} W, feeds the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) and the NECC, when its subthermocline layer feeds the EUC and the North Equatorial Undercurrent. Near-surface eastward flow is present above the EUC during all cruises, yielding to a strong increase of the eastward warm water transport. Copyright 1999 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Observations are presented from six cruises, one conducted in August 1989 and the other five conducted during the Western Tropical Atlantic Experiment between January 1990 and September 1991. The upper water column is divided into two layers, an upper thermocline layer located between the surface and the 24.5 {$\sigma\theta$} isopycnal surface and a lower subthermocline layer located between the 24.5 and 26.75 isopycnals. In the upper layer the NEC retrofiects north of the equator to form the eastward flowing North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC). During the six cruises the retroflection appeared complete. However, data coverage did not extend shoreward of the 200-m isobath, so the possibility of a continuous flow over the shelf still remains. There were also indications of several NEC rings that had apparently separated from the NEC retroflection and drifted to the northwest toward the eastern Caribbean Sea. North of the NEC retroflection and the NECC, the North Equatorial Current (NEC) flows west as the southern limb of the subtropical gyre. Part of the NEC is observed to retroflect cyclonically to join the eastward NECC flow. In the lower layer, beneath the NEC, the North Brazil Undercurrent retrofiects to feed the eastward North Equatorial Undercurrent (NEUC). To the north a deeper component of the NEC recurves to also contribute to the NEUC. Copyright 1999 by the American Geophysical Union.}

  abstract = {The Lagrangian method\textemdash where current location and intensity are determined by tracking the movement of flow along its path\textemdash is the oldest technique for measuring the ocean circulation. For centuries, mariners used compilations of ship drift data to map out the location and intensity of surface currents along major shipping routes of the global ocean. In the mid-20th century, technological advances in electronic navigation allowed oceanographers to continuously track freely drifting surface buoys throughout the ice-free oceans and begin to construct basin-scale, and eventually global-scale, maps of the surface circulation. At about the same time, development of acoustic methods to track neutrally buoyant floats below the surface led to important new discoveries regarding the deep circulation. Since then, Lagrangian observing and modeling techniques have been used to explore the structure of the general circulation and its variability throughout the global ocean, but especially in the Atlantic Ocean. In this review, Lagrangian studies that focus on pathways of the upper and lower limbs of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), both observational and numerical, have been gathered together to illustrate aspects of the AMOC that are uniquely captured by this technique. These include the importance of horizontal recirculation gyres and interior (as opposed to boundary) pathways, the connectivity (or lack thereof) of the AMOC across latitudes, and the role of mesoscale eddies in some regions as the primary AMOC transport mechanism. There remain vast areas of the deep ocean where there are no direct observations of the pathways of the AMOC. Plain Language Summary Measuring ocean currents by following their paths\textemdash rather than by observing them at a fixed location\textemdash is the oldest method for exploring ocean currents. For centuries, mariners used compilations of ship drift data to map out the location and intensity of surface currents along major shipping routes of the global ocean. In the mid-20th century, technological advances in electronic navigation allowed oceanographers to track freely drifting surface buoys continuously throughout the ice-free oceans and begin to construct global maps of the surface currents. At about the same time, the development of methods using sound to track floats below the surface led to important new discoveries regarding the currents bar below the surface. Since then, these techniques have been used to explore the location and strength of currents, and how they change in time, throughout the world's oceans, but especially in the Atlantic Ocean. Computer simulations of the oceans are also used to calculate the pathways of virtual surface drifters and subsurface floats. In this review, studies that use these flow-following methods to measure the pathways of the north-south shallow and deep currents that make up the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (also sometimes referred to as the Great Ocean Conveyor) have been gathered together to illustrate aspects of the conveyor system that are uniquely captured by this technique. These include the importance of large recirculations, or ``waiting areas,'' where water circulates around and around before moving onto the next segment of the conveyor. Also, these techniques for observing ocean currents illustrate how disconnected some parts of the conveyor are, and how swirling, translating pools of water \textasciitilde 100 km in diameter, and not continuous currents, help to move water along the conveyor's path. Vast areas of the deep ocean remain where there are no direct observations of the pathways of the conveyor.},

  abstract = {The seasonal cycle of submesoscale flows in the upper ocean is investigated in an idealised model domain analogous to mid-latitude open ocean regions. Submesoscale processes become much stronger as the resolution is increased, though with limited evidence for convergence of the solutions. Frontogenetical processes increase horizontal buoyancy gradients when the mixed layer is shallow in summer, while overturning instabilities weaken the horizontal buoyancy gradients as the mixed layer deepens in winter. The horizontal wavenumber spectral slopes of surface temperature and velocity are steep in summer and then shallow in winter. This is consistent with stronger mixed layer instabilities developing as the mixed layer deepens and energising the submesoscale. The degree of geostrophic balance falls as the resolution is made finer, with evidence for stronger non-linear and high-frequency processes becoming more important as the mixed layer deepens. Ekman buoyancy fluxes can be much stronger than surface cooling and are locally dominant in setting the stratification and the potential vorticity at fronts, particularly in the early winter. Up to 30\% of the mixed layer volume in winter has negative potential vorticity and symmetric instability is predicted inside mesoscale eddies as well as in the frontal regions outside of the vortices.},

This may mean that upwelling of nutrient-rich water occurs within the eddy, but such upwelling is not captured by models that resolve mesoscale processes. High-resolution simulations presented here show intense submesoscale upwelling from the thermocline to the mixed layer in anticyclonic eddies. The properties of the upwelling are consistent with a process known as symmetric instability. A simple limiting nutrient experiment shows that this upwelling can drive much higher biological activity in anticyclonic eddies when there is a high nutrient concentration in the thermocline. An estimate for the magnitude of upwelling associated with symmetric instability in anticyclonic eddies in the Sargasso Sea shows that it may be of comparable magnitude to other processes, though further work is required to understand the full implications for basin-scale nutrient budgets.},

Recent idealized simulations show that submesoscale instabilities also occur in baroclinic mesoscale cyclones and an- ticyclones. The instabilities in the anticyclone grow faster and at coarser grid resolution than in the cyclone. The instabilities lead to larger restratification in the anticyclone than in the cyclone. The instabilities also lead to changes in the mean azimuthal jet around the anticyclone from 2-km resolution, but a similar effect only occurs in the cyclone at 0.25-kmresolution.Anumerical passive tracer experiment shows that submesoscale instabilities lead to deeper subduction in the interior of anticyclonic than cyclonic eddies because of outcropping isopycnals extending deeper into the thermocline in anticyclones. An energetic analysis suggests that both vertical shear production and vertical buoyancy fluxes are important in anticyclones but primarily vertical buoyancy fluxes occur in cyclones at these resolutions. The energy sources and sinks vary azimuthally around the eddies caused by the asymmetric effects of the Ekman buoyancy flux. Glider transects of a mesoscale anticyclone in the Tasman Sea show that water with low stratification and high oxygen concentrations is found in an anticyclone, in amanner that may be consistent with themodel predictions for submesoscale subduction inmesoscale eddies.},

Being relatively fresh, this water remains in the near-surface layer and can serve as an excellent tracer for the complex and variable flow of the offshore mesoscale eddies. Both surface salinity observations and CZCS (Coastal Zone Color Scanner) imagery can be mapped to estimate the circulation patterns of the eddies. Presented here are two sets of XBT (expendable bathythermograph) sections that give the thermal structure of eddies off the Demerara Rise (6-9\textdegree N). They were occupied nearly contemporaneously with CZCS imagery obtained during October 1980 and November 1981. Several studies have shown from ship drift data, from CZCS observations, and from Geosat altimetry that, particularly during late summer and fall, the NBC is found to retroflect offshore to the east, supplying the North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC) and is associated with eddies along the coast. Good agreement is shown between the CZCS and a NAVOCEANO AXBT (airborne bathythermograph) survey during this period as well as observations of surface phytoplankton and geopotential anomaly from an earlier 1964 survey. Estimates of volume transport within the eddy structure indicate that at times the offshore retroflection during spring as well as autumn can amount to 10 \texttimes{} 106 m3 s-1. The pronounced eddy variability off South America is shown by comparing a number of past hydrographic surveys. These suggest that considerable spatial variability can occur as can seasonal changes in volume transport of the NBC and the associated eddy circulation. \textcopyright{} 1995 Springer-Verlag.}

Cooling peaks south of Iceland where surface temperatures are as much as 28C cooler in 2016 than they were in 2008. Heat uptake by the atmosphere appears to have been affected particularly along the path of the North Atlantic Current. For the reduction in ocean heat transport, changes in ocean heat content account for about one-quarter of the long-term reduction in ocean heat transport while reduced heat uptake by the atmosphere appears to account for the remainder of the change in ocean heat transport.},

  abstract = {In this study, we examine the role of curvature in modifying frontal stability. We first evaluate the classical criterion that the Coriolis parameter f multiplied by the Ertel potential vorticity (PV) q is positive for stable flow and that instability is possible when this quantity is negative. The first portion of this statement can be deduced from Ertel's PV theorem, assuming an initially positive fq. Moreover, the full statement is implicit in the governing equation for the mean geostrophic flow, as the discriminant, fq, changes sign. However, for curved fronts in cyclogeostrophic or gradient wind balance (GWB), an additional term enters the discriminant owing to conservation of absolute angular momentum L. The resulting expression, (1 1 Cu)fq , 0 or Lq , 0, where Cu is a nondimensional number quantifying the curvature of the flow, simultaneously generalizes Rayleigh's criterion by accounting for baroclinicity and Hoskins's criterion by accounting for centrifugal effects. In particular, changes in the front's vertical shear and stratification owing to curvature tilt the absolute vorticity vector away from its thermal wind state; in an effort to conserve the product of absolute angular momentum and Ertel PV, this modifies gradient Rossby and Richardson numbers permitted for stable flow. This forms the basis of a nondimensional expression that is valid for inviscid, curved fronts on the f plane, which can be used to classify frontal instabilities. In conclusion, the classical criterion fq , 0 should be replaced by the more general criterion for studies involving gravitational, centrifugal, and symmetric instabilities at curved density fronts. In Part II of the study, we examine interesting outcomes of the criterion applied to low-Richardson-number fronts and vortices in GWB.},

  abstract = {This is a review about the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), its mean structure, temporal variability, controlling mechanisms, and role in the coupled climate system. The AMOC plays a central role in climate through its heat and freshwater transports. Northward ocean heat transport achieved by the AMOC is responsible for the relative warmth of the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern Hemisphere and is thought to play a role in setting the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone north of the equator. The AMOCis a key means by which heat anomalies are sequestered into the ocean's interior and thus modulates the trajectory of climate change. Fluctuations in the AMOC have been linked to low-frequency variability of Atlantic sea surface temperatures with a host of implications for climate variability over surrounding landmasses. On intra-annual timescales, variability in AMOC is large and primarily reflects the response to local wind forcing; meridional coherence of anomalies is limited to that of the wind field. On interannual to decadal timescales, AMOC changes are primarily geostrophic and related to buoyancy anomalies on the western boundary. A pacemaker region for decadal AMOC changes is located in a western ``transition zone'' along the boundary between the subtropical and subpolar gyres. Decadal AMOC anomalies are communicated meridionally from this region. AMOC observations, aswell as the expanded ocean observational network provided by the Argo array and satellite altimetry, are inspiring efforts to develop decadal predictability systems using coupled atmosphere-ocean models initialized by ocean data.},

In the Gulf Stream region, steep kinetic energy spectra at scales between 200 and 20 km are consistent with predictions of interior quasigeostrophic\textendash turbulence theory, both in the mixed layer and in the thermocline. At scales below 20 km, the spectra flatten out, consistent with a growing contribution of internal-wave energy at small scales. In the subtropical North Pacific, the energy spectra are flatter and inconsistent with predictions of interior quasigeostrophic\textendash turbulence theory. The observed spectra and their dependence on depth are also inconsistent with predictions of surface quasigeostrophic\textendash turbulence theory for the observed ocean stratification. It appears that unbalanced motions, most likely internal tides at large scales and the internal-wave continuum at small scales, dominate the energy spectrum throughout the submesoscale range. Spectra of temperature variance along density surfaces, which are not affected by internal tides, are also inconsistent with predictions of geostrophic-turbulence theories. Reasons for this inconsistency could be the injection of energy in the submesoscale range by small-scale baroclinic instabilities or modifications of the spectra by coupling between surface and interior dynamics or by ageostrophic frontal effects.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Irradiation {$>$}30 kGy is required to achieve sterility against bacterial and viral pathogens in ACL allograft sterilization. However, doses {$>$}20 kGy substantially reduce the structural properties of soft-tissue grafts. Fractionation of irradiation doses is a standard procedure in oncology to reduce tissue damage but has not been applied in tissue graft sterilization. METHODS: Forty-four human 10-mm wide bone-patellar-tendon-bone grafts were randomized into four groups of sterilization with (1) 34 kGy of ebeam (2) 34 kGy gamma (3) 34 kGy fractionated ebeam, and (4) non sterilized controls. Graft s biomechanical properties were evaluated at time zero. Biomechanical properties were analyzed during cyclic and load-to-failure testing. RESULTS: Fractionation of ebeam irradiation resulted in significantly higher failure loads (1,327 +/- 305) than with one-time ebeam irradiation (1,024 +/- 204; P = 0.008). Compared to gamma irradiation, significantly lower strain (2.9 +/- 1.5 vs. 4.6 +/- 2.0; P = 0.008) and smaller cyclic elongation response (0.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.4; P = 0.05), as well as higher failure loads (1,327 +/- 305 vs. 827 +/- 209; P = 0.001), were found. Compared to non-irradiated BPTB grafts, no significant differences were found for any of the biomechanical parameters. Non-irradiated controls had significantly lower cyclic elongation response and higher failure loads than ebeam and gamma irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was found that fractionation of high-dose electron beam irradiation facilitated a significant improvement of viscoelastic and structural properties of BPTB grafts compared to ebeam and gamma irradiation alone, while maintaining levels of non-irradiated controls. Therefore, this technique might pose an important alternative to common methods for sterilization of soft-tissue allografts.},

  abstract = {In the western tropical Atlantic, the North Brazil Current retroflection periodically sheds large anticyclonic rings, which then propagate northwestward. Between 1998 and 2000, the North Brazil Current Rings Experiment sampled a large number of these rings by shipboard and moored acoustic Doppler current profiler. Ten of the sampled rings are analyzed in this study, focusing on their sea surface dynamic properties. The rings exhibit a radial structure consisting of two regimes, an "inner" core region in near solid body rotation and an "outer" ring regime with an approximately exponentially decaying structure. The observations show a sharp change in vorticity at the regime transition and the presence of a strong opposite vorticity shield bounding the inner solid body core. We show that Gaussian models, commonly used to represent the surface expression of these and other rings, are adequate for determining the sea surface height anomaly but tend to poorly estimate other properties such as the maximum swirl velocity. Therefore, we propose a new two-part model as a better approximation of the rings' radial structure. According to the cyclogeostrophic balance approximation, the sea surface height distribution across the inner ring has a parabolic shape, while the outer ring has an exponential structure similar to the velocity field. Interestingly, many of the observed rings have an intensity very close to the theoretical limit for anticyclones at these latitudes, which is believed to be due to inertial instability.

Three of the world's most energetic regions are in the tropical and South Atlantic: the North Brazil Current Retroflection, the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, and the Agulhas Current Retroflection. All three regions display offshore diversions of major boundary currents, which define the intensity of the returning limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. In this work, we use a sea-surface salinity (SSS) satellite product, combined with a high-resolution numerical model and in situ measurements, in order to explore the seasonal variation of the surface currents and transports in these three regions. The analysis of the model output shows that the SSS patterns reflect the surface velocity structure, with the largest horizontal SSS gradients coinciding with those areas of highest velocity and the most predominant velocity vector being 90\textdegree{} anticlockwise (clockwise) from the horizontal SSS gradient in the northern (southern) hemisphere. This information is then applied to the SSS satellite product to obtain maps of water velocity and salt transports, leading to a quantitative tool to estimate both water and salt transports in key regions of the world ocean.}

Since more is known of the tailed structure of the Gulf Stream than of the other currents, the discussion is nfined to it. Specifically, an explanation is advanced for the Florida Current, at portion of the Gulf Stream system in which most of the flow is generated and which the current remains parallel to the coast.

A simple ``frictional geostrophic'' model for one-layer cross- equatorial flow is described, in which geostrophy is replaced at the equator by frictional flow down the pressure gradient. This model is compared via numerical simulations to the one-layer reduced-gravity shallow water model for flow over realistic equatorial Atlantic Ocean bottom topography. It is argued that nonlinear advection is important at key locations where it permits the current to flow against a pressure gradient, a mechanism absent in the frictional geostrophic model and one of the reasons this model predicts less cross-equatorial flow than the shallow water model under similar conditions. Simulations of the shallow water model with an annually varying mass source reproduce the correct amplitude of observed time variability of cross-equatorial flow. The time evolution of volume transport across specific locations suggests that mass is stored in an equatorial basin, which can reduce the amplitude of time dependence of fluid actually proceeding into the Northern Hemisphere as compared to the amount entering the equatorial basin. Observed time series of temperature data at the equator are shown to be consistent with this hypothesis.},

We use an idealized numerical model to simulate a range of baroclinically unstable flows to mimic dynamical regimes ranging from ageostrophic to quasigeostrophic flows. Wavelike signals present in the simulated flows, seen for instance in the vertical velocity, can be related to gravity wave activity identified by frequency and frequency-wavenumber spectra. To explicitly assign the energy contributions to the balanced and unbalanced (gravity) modes, we perform linear and nonlinear modal decomposition to decompose the full state variable into its balanced and unbalanced counterparts. The linear decomposition shows a reasonable separation of the slow and fast modes but is no longer valid when applied to a nonlinear system. To account for the nonlinearity in our system, we apply the normal mode initialization technique proposed by Machenhauer in 1977. Further, we assess the strength of the gravity wave activity and dissipation related to the decomposed modes for different dynamical regimes. We find that gravity wave emission becomes increasingly stronger going from quasigeostrophic to ageostrophic regime. The kinetic energy tied to the unbalanced mode scales close to Ro2 (or Ri-1), with Ro and Ri being the Rossby and Richardson numbers, respectively. Furthermore, internal gravity waves dissipate predominantly through small-scale dissipation, which emphasizes their role in the downscale energy transfer.},

The theoretical model consists of a reduced gravity model of the lens-like vortices with solid body rotation. The application of this approach is tested by comparison with data from the North Brazil Current Rings Experiment and remote sensing data. Specifically, we used the data corresponding to the surfaceintensified North Brazil Current ring (R-3) surveyed in February-March 1999, using direct velocity and hydrographical measurements. The theoretical model was used for evaluating the geometrical structure of the surface-intensified rings that produce remarkable signals in satellite data. The principal ring parameters from the model were compared with those from satellite data (altimetry and drifter information), which were estimated by using the method of minimization of the multivariable objective functions. Although the proposed model is linear in its conception, a good agreement was observed between the model and the primary characteristics of the observed rings. The model, however, allows for improvement in its assumptions, since its application is rather limited to intense ocean rings. \textcopyright{} 2013 Korea Ocean Research \& Development Institute (KORDI) and the Korean Society of Oceanography (KSO) and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Our results compare well with previous experimental results and numerical simulations. Several sizes, intensities and two different vorticity profiles (non-isolated and initially isolated vortices) were tested. Three regimes were found namely: (1) the vortex surrounds the BI and its translational motion (TM) stops North of BI; (2) the vortex passes through the corridor between the LAA and the BI by reducing its size; and (3) The vortex stopped at the entrance to the corridor South of the BI. Isolated vortices were prone to stopped North of the BI. Apparently the intensity in the outer vorticity ring has an influence on the fate of the NBC ring. Non-isolated vortices can also stop its TM North of the BI because when in {$\beta$} plane they develop an outer ring similar to the isolated vortices. From these results we conclude that intense and big NBC rings are likely to stop its TM North of the BI. Medium and moderate vortices stops its TM South of the BI and they reduce their size until they are able to pass through the corridor between the LAA and the BI. Mild vortices of all sizes stop South of the corridor, close to the BI and the LAA. Drifter trajectories and Sea Surface Height altimetry confirm the results.},

Observations at a 1-kilometer-wide front within the Kuroshio Current indicate that the rate of energy dissipation within the boundary layer is enhanced by one to two orders of magnitude, suggesting that the front, rather than the atmospheric forcing, supplied the energy for the turbulence. The data quantitatively support the hypothesis that winds aligned with the frontal velocity catalyzed a release of energy from the front to the turbulence. The resulting boundary layer is stratified in contrast to the classically well-mixed layer. These effects will be strongest at the intense fronts found in the Kuroshio Current, the Gulf Stream, and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, all of which are key players in the climate system.},

  abstract = {Hydrographic and velocity observations of the North Brazil Current (NBC) retroflection region during the 1990-1991 Western Tropical Atlantic Experiment (WESTRAX) are examined with the intent of extracting dynamical information about the NBC eddy shedding. A comparison is performed between the depth structure of empirical orthogonal functions and the dynamical normal modes of the NBC retroflection region on a beta plane centered on 5\textdegree N. The barotropic and first two baroclinic modes account for about 75\% of the vertical structure of the NBC flow. Thus, a three-layer model of the NBC region is suitable for dynamical studies of the NBC retroflection. In terms of flow structure the upper layer represents the retroflection of the surface layers of the NBC to feed the North Equatorial Countercurrent. The middle layer represents the separating subthermocline waters of the NBC which feed the North Equatorial Undercurrent. The third layer represents a weak meandering flow that may be thought of as the Deep Western Boundary Current signature in the three-layer ocean. In terms of PV, a well-defined front separates the NBC waters from the North Equatorial Current in the upper layer. Both upper and middle layers present closed PV contours associated with the eddy in the process of pinching off from the retroflecting NBC. The NBC separation region, although equatorial, complies reasonably well with the basic quasigeostrophic (QG) assumptions. Therefore QG methods are applied to investigate the NBC meander growth. By isolating the effect of PV anomalies in each of the layers on each of the layers, baroclinic growth is verified to occur during the NBC eddy shedding.}

Modeling studies have suggested that convection will weaken as a result of enhanced freshwater input. The emergence of anomalously low sea surface temperature in the subpolar North Atlantic has led to speculation that this process is already at work. Here we show that strong atmospheric forcing in the winter of 2014\textendash 2015, associated with a high North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, produced record mixed layer depths in the Irminger Sea. Local mixing removed the stratification of the upper 1400 m and ventilated the basin to middepths resembling a state similar to the mid-1990s when a positive NAO also prevailed. We show that the strong local atmospheric forcing is predominantly responsible for the negative sea surface temperature anomalies observed in the subpolar North Atlantic in 2015 and that there is no evidence of permanently weakened deep convection.},

One of these tools is Lagrangian ocean analysis, where a set of virtual particles is released and their dynamics are integrated in time based on fields defining the ocean state, including the hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry if available. This popular methodology needs to adapt to the large variety of models producing these fields at different formats. This is precisely the aim of Parcels, a Lagrangian ocean analysis framework designed to combine (1) a wide flexibility to model particles of different natures and (2) an efficient implementation in accordance with modern computing infrastructure. In the new Parcels v2.0, we implement a set of interpolation schemes to read various types of discretized fields, from rectilinear to curvilinear grids in the horizontal direction, from z to s levels in the vertical direction and using grid staggering with the Arakawa A, B and C grids. In particular, we develop a new interpolation scheme for a threedimensional curvilinear C grid and analyse its properties. Parcels v2.0 capabilities, including a suite of meta-field objects, are then illustrated in a brief study of the distribution of floating microplastic in the northwest European continental shelf and its sensitivity to various physical processes.},

  abstract = {Irreversible mixing of tracers and momentum in the ocean occurs via diffusion and friction at the scale of molecules. That such molecular processes profoundly influence basin-scale ocean currents is counter-intuitive. Many successful theories of ocean circulation indeed ignore diffusive and frictional processes. Yet oceanographers have long recognised that turbulence can amplify irreversible mixing and its influence on large-scale flows. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in the mapping of mixing energised by three-dimensional and geostrophic turbulence. This progress not only helps to quantify connections between mixing and observed circulation systems, but also to better characterise these circulation systems. This chapter surveys the rapidly evolving understanding of the impacts of mixing on the strength and structure of major ocean gyres, overturning circulations and the Antarctic circumpolar current. Accumulating evidence suggests that global ocean circulation is shaped by energetic mixing near ocean boundaries, while either weak or largely adiabatic away from boundaries.},

They may also be expressed in noncanonical Hamiltonian form using the usual shallow water Hamiltonian and Poisson bracket.

These are Cartesian approximations to motion in spherical geometry that capture the change with latitude of the angle between the rotation vector and the local vertical. Being derived using Hamilton's principle, the different {$\beta$}-plane approximations each conserve energy, angular momentum and potential vorticity. They differ in their treatments of the locally horizontal component of the rotation vector, the component that is usually neglected under the traditional approximation. In particular, we derive an extended set of {$\beta$}-plane equations in which the locally vertical and locally horizontal components of the rotation vector both vary linearly with latitude. This was previously thought to violate conservation of angular momentum and potential vorticity. We show that the difficulty in maintaining these conservation laws arises from the need to express the rotation vector as the curl of a vector potential while approximating the true spherical metric by a flat Cartesian metric. Finally, we derive depth-averaged equations on our extended {$\beta$}-plane with topography, and show that they coincide with the extended non-traditional shallow-water equations previously derived in Cartesian geometry. \textcopyright{} 2011 Cambridge University Press.},

The non-trivial structure of the bulk Poincar\'e wave modes encoded through the first Chern number of value 2 guarantees existence for these waves. This invariant demonstrates that ocean and atmospheric waves share fundamental properties with topological insulators, and that topology plays an unexpected role in the Earth climate system. One sentence summary: Equatorial Kelvin and Yanai waves, important components of Earth's climate system, have an origin in topology.},

These ocean currents have been found adjacent to the continental slopes of all ocean basins, and have core depths between 1,500 and 4,000 m. In the Atlantic Ocean, the deep western boundary current is estimated to carry (10-40) x 10(6) m3 s(-1) of water, transporting North Atlantic Deep Water--from the overflow regions between Greenland and Scotland and from the Labrador Sea--into the South Atlantic and the Antarctic circumpolar current. Here we present direct velocity and water mass observations obtained in the period 2000 to 2003, as well as results from a numerical ocean circulation model, showing that the Atlantic deep western boundary current breaks up at 8 degrees S. Southward of this latitude, the transport of North Atlantic Deep Water into the South Atlantic Ocean is accomplished by migrating eddies, rather than by a continuous flow. Our model simulation indicates that the deep western boundary current breaks up into eddies at the present intensity of meridional overturning circulation. For weaker overturning, continuation as a stable, laminar boundary flow seems possible.},

  abstract = {In ocean models, the interaction with boundaries is often parameterized as it involves small-scale processes that are usually hard to capture in a large-scale model. However, such interactions can play important roles in the model dynamics. For example, the choice of boundary conditions (free-slip vs. no-slip) has a direct impact on the vorticity (enstrophy) budget: with no-slip boundary conditions, vorticity is injected into the system, whereas with free-slip boundary conditions, there should be no vorticity injection as long as the coastline is smooth. However, we show here that at boundary singularities (e.g., corners), vorticity is injected into the domain even for free-slip boundary conditions. In this article, we use North Brazil Current rings to better understand the dynamics of eddy-topography interaction. This complex interaction is first analyzed in terms of a point vortex interacting with a wall. Within this simplified framework, we can describe the vorticity generation mechanism as a pseudoinviscid process. To quantify this vorticity injection, we first consider the inviscid limit for which we can derive an analytical formula. This theoretical prediction is then evaluated in conventional gridded ocean models. In such models, the representation of such a ``viscous'' boundary interaction may be affected by the grid representation and the discretization of the advection and viscous operators.},

We analyse the observed pattern of homogeneous density layers of 50\textendash 100 m vertical scale, which are characterized by a large meridional coherency up to 2? of latitude, a concentration in the vicinity of the equator and foremost a vertical localization within regions of well-mixed angular momentum (westward jets).

In all the cases examined there exists one particular component which grows faster than any other. It is shown how, by a plocess analogous to ``natural selection'', this component becomes dominant in that almost any disturbance tends eventually to a definite size, structure and growth-rate (and to a characteristic life-history after the disturbance has ceased to be ``small''), which depends only o n the broad characteristics of the initial (unperturbed) system. The characteristic disturbances (forms of breakdown) of certain types of initial system (approximating to those observed in practice) are identified as the ideal forms of the observed cyclone waves and long waves of middle and high latitudes. The implications regarding the ultimate limitations of weather forecasting are discussed.},

There are three desirable properties that a neutral density variable should possess. Firstly, the isosurfaces of this variable should coincide with (approximately) neutral surfaces. This would facilitate the analysis of hydrographic data on the most appropriate mixing and spreading surfaces. Secondly, the horizontal gradients of the neutral density should agree with the gradients of the in situ density, and thirdly the vertical gradient of the neutral density variable should be proportional to the static stability of the water column. A density variable that approximates the latter two properties can be used in ocean circulation models based on layer coordinates, and would reduce substantial errors in present isopycnal models due to the use of a potential density variable. No variable can possess all the three properties simultaneously. The variable {$\gamma$}(n) introduced by Jackett and McDougall (1997, J. Phys. Oceanogr. 27, 237-263) satisfies the first of the properties exactly but is not designed for the use in models. Based on climatological data in the North Atlantic, an alternative neutral density variable v(S, {$\Theta$}) is defined, which is shown to approximate the two gradient criteria much better than any potential density. We suggest that this neutral density variable may be useful in isopycnal ocean models as an alternative to potential density, since it could significantly reduce errors in thermal wind relation and vertical stability.},

In a rectangular domain forced by a localized, Northern Hemisphere mass source and a distributed sink that require a net, cross-equatorial mass flux, a series of numerical experiments investigate how potential vorticity changes sign as fluid crosses the equator. Dissipation is included as momentum diffusion, and the Reynolds number, defined as the ratio of the mass source per unit depth to the viscosity, determines the nature of the flow. For Re less than a critical value (approximately 30) the flow is laminar and well described by linear theory. For Reynolds numbers just above this value, the system becomes time- dependent with eddies of one sign developing adjacent to the boundary and propagating steadily across the equator. For very large Re, an extensive and complicated network of both positive and negative anomalies emerges. Analysis of vorticity fluxes, decomposed into mean, eddy, and frictional elements, reveals the growth with Reynolds number of a turbulent boundary layer that exchanges vorticity between the inertial portion of the boundary current and a frictional sublayer where it is expelled from the basin. Thus, the eddy field is established as an essential mechanism for potential vorticity transformation in nonlinear cross-equatorial flow.},

  abstract = {A linear stability analysis of the shallow-water system in the tropical ocean examines the stability of the western boundary current and its latitudinal dependence. Despite a highly idealized formulation that assumes a purely meridional basic state and makes a local f-plane approximation, the stability analysis successfully predicts a length scale of the disturbance, a latitude for its origin, and a critical Reynolds number that agree well with accompanying numerical results. Realistic western boundary current profiles undergo a horizontal shear instability that is partially stabilized by viscosity. Calculations of the growth rate at several latitudes indicate that the instability is enhanced in the Tropics where the internal deformation radius is a maximum.},

The principal finding is that the horizontal length scale of the most unstable normal mode is determined primarily by the depth of the unstable domain and the slope of isentropic surfaces rather than by the diffusive properties of the fluid. The effects of moisture and the conditions under which inertial circulations are likely to develop in the atmosphere are examined in Part II and compared with observations of mesoscale convective systems. -Author},

  abstract = {The difficulty of simulating a realistic Gulf Stream (GS) that separates from the coast at Cape Hatteras has troubled numerical ocean modelers for a long time, and the problem is evident in different models, from the early models of the 1980s to the modern models of today. The source of the problem is not completely understood yet, since GS simulations are sensitive to many different factors, such as numerical parameterization, model grid, treatment of topography and forcing fields. A curious result of early models is that models with terrain-following vertical grids (e.g., "sigma" or "s" coordinates) seem to achieve a better GS separation than z-level models of similar resolution, so the impact of the vertical grid type on GS simulations is revisited here. An idealized generalized coordinate numerical model is used to compare between a sigma-coordinate grid and a z-level grid while maintaining the same numerical code and model parameters. Short-term diagnostic-prognostic calculations focus on the initial dynamic adjustment of the GS from a given initial condition and imposed boundary conditions. In diagnostic calculations, wherein the three-dimensional flow field is adjusted to time-invariant temperature and salinity data, the GS is quite realistic independent of the grid type. However, when switching to prognostic calculations, the GS in the z-level model tends to immediately develop an unrealistic GS branch that continues along the continental slope instead of separating from the coast at Cape Hatteras. The GS is more realistic in either a sigma-coordinate model or in a z-level model with a vertical wall replacing the continental slope. Increasing the vertical resolution in the z-level model reduces numerical noise, but it does not solve the GS separation problem. Vorticity balance analysis shows that the Joint Effect of Baroclinicity and bottom Relief (JEBAR) and its associated bottom pressure torque are very sensitive to the choice of vertical grid. A stepped topography grid may disrupt the local vorticity balance near steep slopes; this vorticity balance may be important to develop a counterclockwise circulation north of the GS that pushes the GS offshore. Therefore, the study suggests that a smooth representation of bottom topography in ocean models by using either a terrain-following coordinates or a z-level grid with partial cells may allow a more realistic treatment of flow-topography interactions and potentially a better simulation of the GS.},

The geological past can provide insights into climate sensitivity; however, on timescales of millions of years, factors other than CO2 can drive climate, including paleogeographic forcing and solar luminosity. Here, through an ensemble of climate model simulations covering the period 150\textendash 35 million years ago, we show that climate sensitivity to CO2 doubling varies between {$\sim$}3.5 and 5.5 \textdegree C through this time. These variations can be explained as a nonlinear response to solar luminosity, evolving surface albedo due to changes in ocean area, and changes in ocean circulation. The work shows that the modern climate sensitivity is relatively low in the context of the geological record, as a result of relatively weak feedbacks due to a relatively low CO2 baseline, and the presence of ice and relatively small ocean area in the modern continental configuration.},

  abstract = {Multichannel seismic data acquired in the Lesser Antilles in the western tropical North Atlantic indicate that the seismic reflection method has imaged an oceanic thermohaline staircase. Synthetic acoustic modeling using measured density and sound speed profiles corroborates inferences from the seismic data. In a small portion of the seismic image, laterally coherent, uniform layers are present at depths ranging from 550-700m and have a separation of {$\sim$}20 m, with thicknesses increasing with depth. The reflection coefficient, a measure of the acoustic impedance contrasts across these reflective interfaces, is one order of magnitude greater than background noise. Hydrography sampled in previous surveys suggests that the layers are a permanent feature of the region. Spectral analysis of layer horizons in the thermohaline staircase indicates that internal wave activity is anomalously low, suggesting weak internal waveinduced turbulence. Results from two independent measurements, the application of a finescale parameterization to observed high-resolution velocity profiles and direct measurements of turbulent dissipation rate, confirm these low levels of turbulence. The lack of internal wave-induced turbulence may allow for the maintenance of the staircase or may be due to suppression by the double-diffusive convection within the staircase. Our observations show the potential for seismic oceanography to contribute to an improved understanding of occurrence rates and the geographical distribution of thermohaline staircases, and should thereby improve estimates of vertical mixing rates ascribable to salt fingering in the global ocean. \textcopyright{} 2010 Author(s).},

  abstract = {It is generally understood that small-scale mixing, such as is caused by breaking internal waves, drives upwelling of the densest ocean waters that sink to the ocean bottom at high latitudes. However, the observational evidence that the strong turbulent fluxes generated by small-scale mixing in the stratified ocean interior are more vigorous close to the ocean bottom boundary than above implies that small-scale mixing converts light waters into denser ones, thus driving a net sinking of abyssal waters. Using a combination of theoretical ideas and numerical models, it is argued that abyssal waters upwell along weakly stratified boundary layers, where small-scale mixing of density decreases to zero to satisfy the no density flux condition at the ocean bottom. The abyssal ocean meridional overturning circulation is the small residual of a large net sinking of waters, driven by small-scale mixing in the stratified interior above the bottom boundary layers, and a slightly larger net upwelling, driven by the decay of small-scale mixing in the boundary layers. The crucial importance of upwelling along boundary layers in closing the abyssal overturning circulation is the main finding of this work.},

  abstract = {In the western equatorial Atlantic, 5 years of satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) measurements (1998-2002) from the cloud penetrating Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager reveal SST signatures of rings shedding from the North Brazil Current (NBC) as it separates from the South American coastline north of the Amazon River Delta and retroflects eastward between 5 and 10\textdegree N. By removing the spatial-mean SST from a 7\textdegree by 7\textdegree square of the nearly instantaneous measurements of each satellite pass, the 46.7 day aliasing period of the diurnal solar cycle is reduced, and seven to eight rings are observed per year with relatively warm (cold) SST anomalies of up to 1\textdegree C in the first (second) half of the year. The sense of the SST anomalies carried by the NBC rings are determined by the contrast between the NBC SST and the regional SSTs that are influenced by the far-reaching seasonally varying Amazon River freshwater plume. Within a 1.6-year period, 12 of the SST anomalies are validated by in situ mooring array data confirming the predicted sense of the SST anomalies for each season. According to historical hydrographic data, during the first half of the year, the Amazon Plume is generally contained northwest along the coast, whereas during the second half of the year, the Amazon Plume surrounds the NBC retroflection on the west and the north, and from the surface down to 50 m, imposing a dramatic surface salinity contrast up to -4 and a surface temperature contrast up to +2\textdegree C across the front. The surface layer characteristics of the rings shed from the NBC retroflection reveal varying influence of the Amazon Plume. Of the four rings surveyed in the NBCR experiment, Amazon Plume water is found only on the edges of three surface-intensified rings, whereas it completely covers the surface layer of the one thermocline-intensified ring. The maximum current cores of the NBC and retroflection are observed within tens-of-meters of the edges of the Amazon Plume. As the fresher and typically warmer surface waters associated with the Amazon Plume are buoyant relative to the saltier and typically colder surface waters carried by the NBC, the varying position of the Amazon Plume may seasonally influence the surface dynamics in the region. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The tropical Atlantic is home to multiple coupled climate variations covering a wide range of timescales and impacting societally relevant phenomena such as continental rainfall, Atlantic hurricane activity, oceanic biological productivity, and atmospheric circulation in the equatorial Pacific. The tropical Atlantic also connects the southern and northern branches of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and receives freshwater input from some of the world's largest rivers. To address these diverse, unique, and interconnected research challenges, a rich network of ocean observations has developed, building on the backbone of the Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA). This network has evolved naturally over time and out of necessity in order to address the most important outstanding scientific questions and to improve predictions of tropical Atlantic severe weather and global climate variability and change. The tropical Atlantic observing system is motivated by goals to understand and better predict phenomena such as tropical Atlantic interannual to decadal variability and climate change; multidecadal variability and its links to the meridional overturning circulation; air-sea fluxes of CO2 and their implications for the fate of anthropogenic CO2; the Amazon River plume and its interactions with biogeochemistry, vertical mixing, and hurricanes; the highly productive eastern boundary and equatorial upwelling systems; and oceanic oxygen minimum zones, their impacts on biogeochemical cycles and marine ecosystems, and their feedbacks to climate. Past success of the tropical Atlantic observing system is the result of an international commitment to sustained observations and scientific cooperation, a willingness to evolve with changing research and monitoring needs, and a desire to share data openly with the scientific community and operational centers. The observing system must continue to evolve in order to meet an expanding set of research priorities and operational challenges. This paper discusses the tropical Atlantic observing system, including emerging scientific questions that demand sustained ocean observations, the potential for further integration of the observing system, and the requirements for sustaining and enhancing the tropical Atlantic observing system.},

Both components are publicly available and subjected to regular, automated regression tests. The modeling framework includes sets of global conformal grids, a global model setup, implementations of data constraints and control parameters, an interface to algorithmic differentiation, as well as a grid-independent, fully capable Matlab toolbox. The baseline ECCO v4 solution is a dynamically consistent ocean state estimate without unidentified sources of heat and buoyancy, which any interested user will be able to reproduce accurately. The solution is an acceptable fit to most data and has been found to be physically plausible in many respects, as documented here and in related publications. Users are being provided with capabilities to assess model-data misfits for themselves. The synergy between modeling and data synthesis is asserted through the joint presentation of the modeling framework and the state estimate. In particular, the inverse estimate of parameterized physics was instrumental in improving the fit to the observed hydrography, and becomes an integral part of the ocean model setup available for general use. More generally, a first assessment of the relative importance of external, parametric and structural model errors is presented. Parametric and external model uncertainties appear to be of comparable importance and dominate over structural model uncertainty. The results generally underline the importance of including turbulent transport parameters in the inverse problem.},

These submesoscale flows drive upwelling of interior waters into the surface mixed layer. Our findings thus demonstrate that Gal\'apagos upwelling is controlled by highly localized atmosphere\textendash ocean interactions, and call for a focus on these processes in assessing and mitigating the regional ecosystem's vulnerability to 21st-century climate change.},

  abstract = {Abstract An eddy-resolving numerical ocean circulation model is used to investigate the pathways of low-latitude intergyre mass transport associated with the upper limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning cell (MOC). Numerical experiments with and without applied wind stress and an imposed MOC exhibit significant differences in intergyre transport, western boundary current intensity, and mesoscale ring production. The character of interaction between low-latitude wind- and overturning-driven circulation systems is found to be predominantly a linear superposition in the annual mean, even though nonlinearity in the form of diapycnal transport is essential to some segments of the mean pathway. Within a mesoscale band of 10\textendash 100 day period, significant nonlinear enhancement of near-surface variability is observed. In a realistically forced model experiment, a 14 Sv upper-ocean MOC return flow is partitioned among three pathways connecting the equatorial and tropical wind-driven gyres. A frictional western boundary current with both surface and intermediate depth components is the dominant pathway and accounts for 6.8 Sv of intergyre transport. A diapycnal pathway involving wind-forced equatorial upwelling and interior Ekman transport is responsible for 4.2 Sv. Translating North Brazil Current rings contribute approximately 3.0 Sv of intergyre transport.},

Surface drifters and shallow (250 m) subsurface floats that looped within NBC rings were more likely to enter the Caribbean through the passages of the Lesser Antilles than were deeper (500 or 900 m) floats, indicating that the regional bathymetry preferentially inhibits transport of intermediate-depth ring components.

  abstract = {Abstract Depth-dependent barotropic instability of short mixed Rossby?gravity (MRG) waves is proposed as a mechanism for the formation of equatorial zonal jets. High-resolution primitive equation simulations show that a single MRG wave of very short zonal wavelength and small to moderate amplitude is unstable and leads to the development of a largely barotropic, zonally symmetric flow, featuring a westward jet at the equator and extra-equatorial jets alternating in direction with latitude. At higher but still moderate amplitude, westward flow still prevails at the equator at depths of maximum horizontal velocity amplitude in the initial wave, but the long-term equilibrated state can also feature eastward ?superrotating? jets at the equator near the depths of zero horizontal velocity in the initial wave. The formation of the superrotating jets in the simulations is found to be sensitive to the inclusion of the nontraditional Coriolis force in the equations of motion. A linear theory is used to demonstrate the existence of exponentially growing horizontally nondivergent perturbations with a dominant zonally symmetric zonal velocity component. An argument for the sense and positioning of the jets relative to the equator is given in terms of inertial instability and the meridional mixing of planetary vorticity by the small zonal-scale components of the linearly unstable modes. In the long time evolution of the flow, if the amplitude of the westward equatorial jet becomes too great, zonally symmetric inertial instability limits the growth of the jets, and inertial adjustment leads to the homogenization of potential vorticity in latitude and depth around the equator.},

They use a coarse-resolution single-basin sector coupled general circulation model (CGCM) with simplified atmospheric physics and two idealized land\textendash sea distributions. In an equatorially symmetric closed-basin setting, unforced climate asymmetry develops because of the advective circulation\textendash salinity feedback that amplifies the asymmetry of the deep-MOC cell and the upper- ocean meridional salinity transport. It confines the deep-water production and the dominant extratropical ocean heat release to a randomly selected hemisphere. The resultant ocean heat transport (OHT) toward the hemisphere with the deep-water source is partially compensated by the atmospheric heat transport (AHT) across the equator via an asymmetric Hadley circulation, setting the ITCZ in the hemisphere warmed by the ocean. When a circumpolar channel is open at subpolar latitudes, the circumpolar current disrupts the poleward transport of the upper-ocean saline water and suppresses deep-water formation poleward of the channel. The MOC adjusts by lowering the main pycnocline and shifting the deep-water production into the opposite hemisphere from the channel, and the ITCZ location follows the deep-water source again because of the Hadley circulation adjustment to cross-equatorial OHT. The climate response is sensitive to the sill depth of the channel but becomes saturated when the sill is deeper than the main pycnocline depth in subtropics. In simulations with a circumpolar channel, the ITCZ is in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) because of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) circumpolar flow that forces northward OHT.},

The increased freshwater output from Antarctica is important in determining sea level rise, the fate of Antarctic sea ice and its effect on the Earth's albedo, ongoing changes in global deep-ocean ventilation, and the evolution of Southern Ocean ecosystems and carbon cycling. A key uncertainty in assessing and predicting the impacts of Antarctic Ice Sheet melting concerns the vertical distribution of the exported meltwater. This is usually represented by climate-scale models as a near-surface freshwater input to the ocean, yet measurements around Antarctica reveal the meltwater to be concentrated at deeper levels. Here we use observations of the turbulent properties of the meltwater outflows from beneath a rapidly melting Antarctic ice shelf to identify the mechanism responsible for the depth of the meltwater. We show that the initial ascent of the meltwater outflow from the ice shelf cavity triggers a centrifugal overturning instability that grows by extracting kinetic energy from the lateral shear of the background oceanic flow. The instability promotes vigorous lateral export, rapid dilution by turbulent mixing, and finally settling of meltwater at depth. We use an idealized ocean circulation model to show that this mechanism is relevant to a broad spectrum of Antarctic ice shelves. Our findings demonstrate that the mechanism producing meltwater at depth is a dynamically robust feature of Antarctic melting that should be incorporated into climate-scale models.},

North Atlantic simulation with the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM) is analyzed in a region of the Tropical Atlantic characterized by the presence of the North Brazil Current (NBC) retroflection and North Brazil Current rings. The model mean and seasonal circulations present a good qualitative agreement with observations. Quantitatively, the modeled NBC in summer and fall does not completely retroflect into the North Equatorial Counter Current, and the model upper 100 m NBC is more intense than the observed values by 3-4 Sv. The modeled NBC generates a variety of rings, which we classify as 'shallow', 'intermediate', 'deep', and 'subsurface'. An average of 8.3 rings of all types are generated per year, of which 6 are surface intensified, in good agreement with altimetry (5.7 rings per year, Goni and Johns, 2001). The transport of southern origin water by the the rings was estimated using two methods. First, the transport was computed kinematically from the rings' volume, resulting in an average transport of 6.6 Sv. Second, an estimation of southern water transport based on an explicit calculation of water mass content was done, resulting in an average transport of 7.5 Sv. The rings' contribution represents 0\% of the total meridional transport from the surface to the intermediate water layers. Possible mechanisms operating in the model ring generation are briefly discussed. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {A subset of data collected as a part of a larger program, the North Brazil Current Rings (NBCR) Experiment, is analyzed to study the variability of the transport of the North Brazil Current (NBC) and its relation with the shedding of rings. It is concluded that there is a direct relation between the latitude of penetration, the number of rings shed, and the intensity of the NBC. The data set consists of dynamic height time series derived from three inverted echo sounders and a shallow pressure gauge deployed along a section perpendicular to the South American coast between the continent and 7\textdegree N, and between 48\textdegree{} and 45\textdegree W. Velocity and hydrographic data collected during the NBCR cruises are also analyzed and used to validate the results. The 15-month mean transport of the NBC is 16 {$\pm$} 2 Sv. The 18-month mean of the retroflected southeastward flow is 22 {$\pm$} 2 Sv. Both flows display considerable variability. The retroflected southeast flow reaches its maximum value during September 1999, near the time when the climatological North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) reaches its maximum strength and it is minimum when the climatological NECC reverses or is not present in the basin. The mean difference between the NBC flow and the retroflected flow during August-December 1999 when the NECC is fully established is -7 Sv. The excess in the retroflected flow is due to North Atlantic water joining the retroflected flow from the South Atlantic. The combination of both flows constitutes the NECC.

In the subsurface, it is primarily governed by lateral buoyancy uxes during early spring. The roles of three different eddy types in this process are assessed using an idealizedmodel of the Labrador Sea that simulates the restratication season. The rst eddy type, warm-core Irminger rings, is shed fromthe boundary current along thewest coast ofGreenland.All along the coastline, the boundary current forms boundary current eddies. The third type, convective eddies, arises directly around the convection area. In themodel, the latter two eddy types are together responsible for replenishing 30\%of thewinter heat losswithin 6months. Irminger rings add another 45\%to this number. The authors' results thus conrmthat the presence of Irminger rings is essential for a realistic amount of restratication in this area. The model results are compared to observations using theoretical estimates of restratication time scales derived for the three eddy types. The time scales are also used to explain contradicting conclusions in previous studies on their respective roles. \textcopyright{} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

Equivalents of Rayleigh's and Fjortoft's criteria and the semicircle theorem for parallel shear flow are given, and the energy equation shows the instability to be barotropic. A new result is that the fastest growing perturbation is often an internal instability, having a finite vertical scale, but may also be an external instability, having no vertical structure. For parallel shear flow the fastest growing perturbation is always an external instability; this is Squire's theorem. Whether the fastest growing perturbation is internal or external depends upon the profile: for mean flow streamfunction profiles which monotonicaliy decrease with radius, the instability is internal for less steep profiles with a broad velocity extremum and external for steep profiles with a narrow velocity extremum. Finite amplitude, numerical model calculations show that this linear instability analysis is not valid very far into the finite amplitude range, and that a barotropic vortex, whose fastest growing perturbation is internal, is vertically fragmented by the instability. \textcopyright{} 1986, Taylor  \&  Francis Group, LLC.

The water column was separated into two layers, the upper layer from the sea-surface to the 24.5 isopycnal and lower layer from the 24.5 to the 26.8 isopycnal. The upper layer includes the NBC, the South Equatorial Current, the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) and a portion of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC). The lower layer includes the North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC), the South Equatorial Undercurrent (SEUC), the North Equatorial Undercurrent (NEUC) and another portion of the EUC. With respect to earlier work, the data show that (1) the SEUC is primarily fed by waters from a recirculation gyre on its northern boundary with some minor transport retroflecting from the NBUC; (2) the EUC is fed primarily by southern hemisphere waters that retroflect from the NBC, but there is some northern hemisphere water in the near surface flow that connects the EUC and NEUC during this cruise; (3) the NECC during this cruise has no connection to the NBC and is fed by northern hemisphere waters originating in the North Equatorial Current; and (4) the majority of the upper layer NBC that crosses 44\textdegree W does not appear to retroflect from the boundary farther north to return equatorward. New results include: (1) quantification, for this period, of the amount of transport in the single current core at 44\textdegree W that is comprised of waters from the southern (9.2 Sv) and northern hemispheres (5.2 Sv); (2) demonstration that the single core of eastward flow at 44\textdegree W and 41\textdegree W separates into the NEUC and EUC by 35\textdegree W, with the former composed of northern hemisphere waters and the latter southern hemisphere waters; (3) demonstration that the precursor to the EUC (NEUC) at 44\textdegree W and 41\textdegree W accelerates (decelerates) by 35\textdegree W; and (4) depiction of the potential vorticity (PV) field showing that the PV front at 44\textdegree W has separated into a front of higher PV values coincident with NEUC and a low PV core at 35\textdegree W coincident with the EUC. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Results from experiments (i) show that eddies are generated at the equatorial region by shear instability and detached northward; eddies are responsible for an enhancement of the mean flow and the variability of the MOC. Results from experiments (ii) show a transitional behavior of the MOC related to the eddy generation in interannual\textendash decadal time scales as the Reynolds number varies due to the variations in the MOC. In experiments (iii), a critical Reynolds number Rec around 30 is found, above which eddies are generated. Experiments (iv...},

The ensemble of ring trajectories closely parallels the 500 m isobath, and one out of six rings penetrate into the Caribbean Sea through the southern Lesser Antilles. The rest of the rings and eddies follow a northern trajectory past Barbados once they reach 58W. Their estimated mean translation speed is 14 km/day and their mean length scale is approximately 100 km. Our results suggest that the formation rate of NBC rings and eddies is nearly twice that previously thought, and that they may account for more than 1/3 of the interhemispheric transport within the Atlantic meridional overturning cell.}

Using a coupled dynamical-biogeochemical model, we show that contrary to this suggestion, TIWs induce a decrease of iron concentration by 10\% at the equator and by about 3\% over the Wyrtki box [90\textdegree W-180, 5\textdegree N-5\textdegree S]. Chlorophyll decreases by 10\% at the equator and 1\% over the Wyrtki box. This leads to a decrease of new production up to 10\% at the equator (4\% over the Wyrtki box). TIW-induced horizontal advection exports iron-rich equatorial water to the north, but also brings iron-depleted water to the equator leading to a net decrease in iron. Additional iron decrease is caused by TIW-induced iron vertical diffusion. These two mechanisms are partly counter balanced by a decrease of iron biological uptake, driven by lower phytoplankton concentrations, and to a lesser extent by TIW-induced iron vertical advection.

  abstract = {The inertial instability of equatorial shear flows is studied, with a view to understand-ing observed phenomena in the Earth's stratosphere and mesosphere. The basic state is a zonal flow of stratified fluid on an equatorial {$\beta$}-plane, with latitudinal shear. The simplest self-consistent model of the instability is used, so that the basic state and the disturbances are zonally symmetric, and a vertical diffusivity provides the scale selection. We study the interaction between the inertial instability, which takes the form of periodically varying disturbances in the vertical, and the mean flow, where 'mean' is a vertical mean. The weakly nonlinear regime is investigated analytically, for flows with an arbitrary dependence on latitude. An amplitude equation of the form dA/dt = A - k 2 A |A| 2 dt is derived for the disturbances, and the evolving stability properties of the mean flow are discussed. In the final steady state, the disturbances vanish, but there is a persistent mean flow change that stabilizes the flow. However, the magnitude of the mean flow change depends strongly on the initial conditions, so that the system has a long memory. The analysis is extended to include the effects of Rayleigh friction and Newtonian cooling, destroying the long-memory property. A more strongly nonlinear regime is investigated with the help of numerical simulations, extending the results up to the point where the instability leads to density contour overturning. The instability is shown to lead to a homogenization of fQ around the initially unstable region, where f is the Coriolis parameter, and Q is the vertical mean of the potential vorticity. As the instability evolves, the line of zero Q moves polewards, rather than equatorwards as might be expected from a simple self-neutralization argument.},

However, it is not clear why the vertical wavelength of the observed structures is much greater than that predicted by the simple linear theory, based on a vertical scale selection by molecular diffusion. Here, a nonlinear mechanism is described that can lead to upscaling from structures with short vertical wavelengths to long vertical wavelengths. The mechanism is dependent upon a secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that develops as the inertial instability grows. Numerical simulations on an equatorial {$\beta$} plane, employing a simple parameterization of the vertical transport of horizontal momentum due to the secondary instability, are used to assess the likely degree of upscaling in a zonally symmetric system. For a fluid with buoyancy frequency N, it is shown that upscaling toward the buoyancy cutoff wavenumber 4N{$\beta$}/ {$\wedge$}2 can occur, even when diffusion is so weak that the wavelength of the most unstable linear mode is much smaller than the buoyancy cutoff wavelength. Thus, the simulated latitudinal and vertical structure of the instability in the nonlinear regime is significantly different from that predicted by the linear theory, and can explain the scales of the structures observed near the equatorial stratopause. \textcopyright{} 2003 American Meteorological Society.},

We argue in this article that drainage of potential energy from the geostrophic flow is a significant source of their growth. We illustrate our point with two-dimensional Boussinesq numerical simulations of oceanic density fronts on the f plane. A set of two-dimensional initial conditions covers the submesoscale portion of a three-dimensional parameter space consisting of the Richardson and Rossby numbers and a measure of stratification or latitude. Because we let the lateral density gradient decay with depth, the parameter space map is nontrivial, excluding low-Rossby, low-Richardson combinations. Dissipation and the presence of boundaries select a growing mode of inertial-symmetric instability consisting of flow cells that disturb isopycnal contours. Systematically, these isopycnal displacements correspond to a drainage of potential energy from the geostrophic fronts to the ageostrophic perturbations. In the majority of our experiments, this energy drainage is at least as important as the drainage of kinetic energy from the front. Various constraints, some physical, some numerical, make the energetics in our experiments more related to inertial rather than symmetric instabilities. Our results depend very weakly on the Richardson number and more on the Rossby number and relative stratification.},

This seasonal tropical SSS maximum, which is confirmed by comparison to in situ observations, is centered at 8\textdegree N, and is up to 0.5 psu saltier than the surrounding water despite its location in the latitude band of the highly precipitating Intertropical Convergence Zone. Its existence seems to be the result of the differing phases in the seasonal variations of Amazon discharge and ocean currents. In late boreal fall/ winter, when the discharge is at its minimum, but the North Brazil Current (NBC) and its retroflection are still present, a mixture of high-salinity water of equatorial and South Atlantic origin is transported along the shelf break by the NBC retroflecting into the western part of the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC). This salt transport produces the salty signature of the western part of the NECC, which is seen as a localized salinity maximum on satellite imagery, in contrast to the fresh signature present in summer-early fall. The seasonal slowing/reversal of the NECC in boreal spring stops this eastward salt transport, thus leading to the disappearance of this northwestern tropical SSS maximum. \textcopyright 2014.

To achieve equilibrium the geostrophic currents must viscously dissipate their kinetic energy at much smaller scale. However, geostrophic turbulence is characterized by an inverse cascade of energy towards larger scale, and the pathways of energy toward dissipation are still in question. Here, we present a mechanism, in the context of the Gulf Stream, where energy is transferred from the geostrophic flow to submesoscale wakes through anticyclonic vertical vorticity generation in the bottom boundary layer. The submesoscale turbulence leads to elevated local dissipation and mixing outside the oceanic boundary layers. This process is generic for boundary slope currents that flow in the direction of Kelvin wave propagation. Topographic generation of submesoscale flows potentially provides a new and significant route to energy dissipation for geostrophic flows.},

  abstract = {A hierarchy of hydrodynamical instabilities controlling the transfer of buoyancy through the oceanic mixed layer is reviewed. If a resting ocean of horizontally uniform stratification is subject to spatially uniform buoyancy loss at the sea surface, then gravitational instability ensues in which buoyancy is drawn from depth by upright convection. But if spatial inhomogeneities in the ambient stratification or the forcing are present (as always exist in nature), then horizontal density gradients will be induced and, within a rotation period, horizontal currents in thermal-wind balance with those gradients will be set up within the mixed layer. There are two important consequences on the convective process: 1) Upright convection will become modified by the presence of the thermal wind shear; fluid parcels are exchanged not along vertical paths but, rather, along slanting paths in symmetric instability. Theoretical considerations suggest that this slantwise convection sets the potential vorticity of the mixed layer fluid to zero but, in general, will leave it stably stratified in the vertical. 2) The convective process ultimately gives way to a baroclinic instability of the horizontal mixed layer density gradients. The resulting baroclinic waves are important agents of buoyancy transport through the mixed layer and can be so efficient that the convective process all but ceases. The authors illustrate and quantify these ideas by numerical experiment with a highly resolved nonhydrostatic Navier\textendash Stokes model. Uniform spatial cooling at the surface of a resting, stratified fluid in a 2{$\frac{1}{2}$}-dimensional model on an f plane, in which zonal strips of fluid conserve their absolute momentum, causes energetic vertical overturning. A well-mixed boundary layer develops over a depth that is accurately predicted by a simple 1D law. In contrast, differential surface cooling induces a mixed layer front. Fluid parcels, made dense at the surface, sink along slanting trajectories in intense nonhydrostatic plumes. After cooling ceases the Ertel potential vorticity within the convective layer is indeed found to be vanishingly small, corresponding to convective neutrality measured in the absolute momentum surfaces that are tilted from the vertical by the horizontal vorticity of the thermal wind. In analogous fully three-dimensional calculations, the absolute momentum constraint is broken, and the convection at first coexists with, but is ultimately dominated by, a baroclinic instability of the mixed layer. For typical mixed layer depths of 500 m stability analysis predicts, and our explicit calculations confirm, that baroclinic waves with length scalesO(5 km) develop with timescales of a day or so. By diagnosis of fully developed mixed layer turbulence, the authors assess the importance of the baroclinic eddy field as an agency of lateral and vertical buoyancy flux through the layer. A novel scaling for the lateral buoyancy flux due to the baroclinic eddies is suggested. These ideas are based on analysis of several experiments in which the initial stratification, rotation rate, and buoyancy forcing are varied, and the results are compared to previous attempts to parameterize the effects of baroclinic instability. There is a marked difference between the scaling that accounts for the resolved experiments and the Fickian schemes used traditionally in large-scale ocean models. Finally, consideration of the results in light of high-resolution mixed layer hydrographic surveys in the northeast Atlantic suggests mixed layer baroclinic instability may be very important at fronts. The authors speculate that the process exerts a large influence on the character of newly subducted thermocline water throughout the extratropical ocean.},

  abstract = {Computational oceanography is the study of ocean phenomena by numerical simulation, especially dynamical and physical phenomena. Progress in information technology has driven exponential growth in the number of global ocean observations and the fidelity of numerical simulations of the ocean in the past few decades. The growth has been exponentially faster for ocean simulations, however. We argue that this faster growth is shifting the importance of field measurements and numerical simulations for oceanographic research. It is leading to the maturation of computational oceanography as a branch of marine science on par with observational oceanography. One implication is that ultraresolved ocean simulations are only loosely constrained by observations. Another implication is that barriers to analyzing the output of such simulations should be removed. Although some specific limits and challenges exist, many opportunities are identified for the future of computational oceanography. Most important is the prospect of hybrid computational and observational approaches to advance understanding of the ocean.},

  abstract = {Synthetic floats are released in an ocean general circulation model to study fluid pathways followed by the upper limb of the meridional overturning circulation from the subtropical South Atlantic to the subtropical North Atlantic. The floats are designed to track this fundamentally three-dimensional, non-isentropic flow while sampling water properties and all terms of the equation governing the vertical component of relative vorticity. The low-resolution ocean simulations demonstrate how upper-limb flow navigates the complex, time-dependent system of wind-driven gyres. Pathways that extend into the interior North Atlantic before entering the Caribbean Sea are emphasized over the more direct western boundary route. A large number of floats are released in the southern hemisphere to verify the importance of such interior pathways in the model and document key events that occur along them. Upper limb water first approaches the equator in a modified inertial western boundary layer. Equatorial processes (visco-inertial boundary layer dynamics, upwelling, heating) are necessary to reset water properties and permit fluid to permanently cross the equator, typically requiring eastward retroflection into the EUC. After upwelling at the equator, fluid that does not advect northward or southward into the interior returns to the western boundary and turns northward in a frictional western boundary layer. The generation of negative relative vorticity by planetary vorticity advection can break the boundary layer constraint and permit retroflection into the NECC near 5\textdegree{} N from late spring through fall. Once in the interior, this fluid advects northward into the southern subtropical gyre in a flow governed by Ekman dynamics. There the fluid subducts and advects southwestward to enter the Caribbean Sea under the influence of layered thermocline dynamics. The importance of interior pathways is confirmed although we note that fluid parcels generally take complex paths and frequently make multiple attempts to enter the northern hemisphere or multiple treks around gyres. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The regions of enhanced surface wind speed seen in previous studies are reproduced and shown to be primarily the result of promontories in the orography along the southeast coast (the maxima disappear in experiments without the promontories). Two mechanisms are proposed to explain these enhancements. Firstly, a reduction in pressure experienced by the flow as it passes a promontory results in an acceleration akin to that of easterly tip jets at Cape Farewell. Secondly, mountain waves observed along the southeast coast are accompanied by strong, low-level downslope winds in the lee of the promontories. Both mechanisms contribute to the simulated wind speed maxima.},

  abstract = {Rocketsonde observations at Kwajalein (8.7\textdegree N, 167.7\textdegree E) were used for investigation of horizontal wind disturbances induced by inertial instability. Two characteristic cases were found in the 1978-1979 northern winter during which the limb infrared monitor of the stratosphere (LIMS) made observations. In both the cases the eastward component and the northward component of horizontal winds are negatively correlated in the vertical direction near the stratopause level, which is thought to be due to inertial instability. The wind disturbances have a wavelength of about 10 km, and their maximum amplitudes are estimated as over 10 ms-1. Examinations of the LIMS temperatures support a possibility that the wind disturbances are induced by inertial instability. It was revealed that temperature disturbances characteristic of inertial instability, called "pancake structures," appear in the same height and time as the wind disturbances do. The relationship between the rocketsonde wind disturbances and the LIMS pancake structures is 90\textdegree{} out of phase, as expected by the theory of inertial instability. In addition, it was confirmed that the two inertial instability events follow enhancements of the midlatitude planetary wave. This is consistent with a mechanism of the inertially unstable disturbances in the equatorial region inferred in some observational and numerical studies. Analyses of rocketsonde data were extended to the entire observation period at Kwajalein, which suggests that the occurrence of inertially unstable disturbances is biased toward the winter season. However, at some other stations in the tropics, wind disturbances which may be induced by inertial instability do not appear so frequently as they do at Kwajalein. This seasonality and regionality of inertially unstable disturbances would be due to the seasonality and regionality of planetary wave breakings at midlatitude.

Here 16 Sv (=106 m3 s-1) of MOC water flows to the equator from the south, primarily in the North Brazil Current. The MOC water recirculates in the tropics and, after crossing the equator about half of it, stays along the western boundary and the other half loops in a cyclonic circulation northward to join the North Equatorial Current. The STC on the Southern Hemisphere has a strength of 4 Sv. The northern STC has a strength of 1.5 Sv; it is confined to the retroflection area close to the equator and it contains primarily MOC water. In total, 5.5 Sv of MOC water entrains into the mixed layer in the tropical Atlantic. Here 2 Sv of MOC water recirculates in the southern STC and 1.5 Sv in the northern STC. The STCs are weaker than suggested from observations, but the interior flows in the model compare well to observations. The heat transport divergence that is associated with warming of MOC water masses between 10\textdegree S and 10\textdegree N is 0.22 PW (=1015W). The fresh water transport divergence of MOC water masses in the tropical Atlantic is 0.16 Sv. It is concluded that the MOC can substantially affect the tropical circulation, but the tropical circulation itself can also affect MOC properties. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.}

Observations suggest a heat transport by the AMOC of 1.3 PW at 26\textdegree N\textemdash a latitude which is close to where the Atlantic northward heat transport is thought to reach its maximum. This shapes the climate of the North Atlantic region as we know it today. In recent years there has been significant progress both in our ability to observe the AMOC in nature and to simulate it in numerical models. Most previous modeling investigations of the AMOC and its impact on climate have relied on models with horizontal resolution that does not resolve ocean mesoscale eddies and the dynamics of the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Current system. As a result of recent increases in computing power, models are now being run that are able to represent mesoscale ocean dynamics and the circulation features that rely on them. The aim of this review is to describe new insights into the AMOC provided by high-resolution models. Furthermore, we will describe how high-resolution model simulations can help resolve outstanding challenges in our understanding of the AMOC.},

  abstract = {Chapter 6 showed that the quasi-geostrophic equations can qualitatively account for the observed relationships among the vorticity, temperature, and vertical velocity fields in midlatitude synoptic-scale systems. The diagnostic approach used in that chapter provided useful insights into the structure of synoptic-scale systems; it also demonstrated the key role of potential vorticity in dynamical analysis. It did not, however, provide quantitative information on the origins, growth rates, and propagation speeds of such disturbances. This chapter shows how the linear perturbation analysis of Chapter 5 can be used to obtain such information from the quasi-geostrophic equations. The development of synoptic-scale weather disturbances is often referred to as cyclogenesis, a term that emphasizes the role of relative vorticity in developing synoptic-scale systems. This chapter analyzes the processes that lead to cyclogenesis. Specifically, we discuss the role of dynamical instability of the mean flow in accounting for the growth of synoptic-scale disturbances. Moreover, even in the absence of such instability, we show that baroclinic disturbances may still amplify over finite periods of time if properly configured. Thus the quasi-geostrophic equations can, indeed, provide a reasonable theoretical basis for understanding the development of synoptic-scale storms, although as discussed in Section 9.2, ageostrophic effects must be included to model the development of fronts and subsynoptic-scale storms.},

  abstract = {We explore the nature of inertial equilibration of equatorial flows in the presence of mean meridional and vertical shears of the basic state, with oceanic applications in mind. The study is motivated by the observational evidence that the subthermocline equatorial mean circulation displays nearly zero Ertel potential vorticity away from the equator, when taking into account the non-traditional horizontal component of the Earth rotation. This observed state precisely verifies the marginal condition for inertial instability: a linear analysis for the equatorial {$\beta$}-plane confirms that the usual condition of instability, namely that Ertel potential vorticity should be of opposite sign to the vertical Coriolis parameter, remains valid even when the traditional approximation is relaxed. Analytical linear normal modes reveal that a meridional shear of the basic state leads to a vertical stacking of equatorially-trapped zonal flows of alternate signs, with a new centre of symmetry located at the dynamical equator. A vertical shear of the basic state causes a meridional stacking of extra-equatorial zonal flows. In an inviscid framework, a two-dimensional formulation is ill-posed and we resort to non-hydrostatic viscous simulations to determine the nonlinear normal forms of the system. The influence of a small-scale eddy diffusivity and a large-scale Rayleigh damping on the equilibrated vertical scale is determined numerically. The nonlinear equilibration occurs through a steady-state bifurcation from a basic state without jets to another steady state with secondary jets of alternate signs. The final state corresponds to eastward jets located on the geographic equator, while westward jets are located near the dynamical equator. These results are consistent with in situ observations of equatorial deep jets. The analogy between the equatorial meridional shear flow and the cylindrical Couette\textendash Taylor flow with an axial density stratification is detailed. There is a strong similarity in the general symmetries and nonlinear normal forms of the two problems. Similarly to the homogeneous Couette\textendash Taylor flow, the gap width between the two cylinders is important for determining the axial scale of the secondary flow through the Reynolds number. For the equatorial problem, an upper bound for the height scale of inertial jets is such that the corresponding equatorial radius of deformation times {$\surd$}2 fits between the geographic and dynamic equators. One of our main conclusions is that the raison d ' \^etre of the observed region of zero Ertel potential vorticity is to facilitate angular momentum exchanges between the two hemispheres and inertial deep jets are the byproducts of this angular momentum mixing.},

  abstract = {The impacts of a hypothetical slowdown in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) are assessed in a state-of-the-art global climate model (HadGEM3), with particular emphasis on Europe. This is the highest resolution coupled global climate model to be used to study the impacts of an AMOC slowdown so far. Many results found are consistent with previous studies and can be considered robust impacts from a large reduction or collapse of the AMOC. These include: widespread cooling throughout the North Atlantic and northern hemisphere in general; less precipitation in the northern hemisphere midlatitudes; large changes in precipitation in the tropics and a strengthening of the North Atlantic storm track. The focus on Europe, aided by the increase in resolution, has revealed previously undiscussed impacts, particularly those associated with changing atmospheric circulation patterns. Summer precipitation decreases (increases) in northern (southern) Europe and is associated with a negative summer North Atlantic Oscillation signal. Winter precipitation is also affected by the changing atmospheric circulation, with localised increases in precipitation associated with more winter storms and a strengthened winter storm track. Stronger westerly winds in winter increase the warming maritime effect while weaker westerlies in summer decrease the cooling maritime effect. In the absence of these circulation changes the cooling over Europe's landmass would be even larger in both seasons. The general cooling and atmospheric circulation changes result in weaker peak river flows and vegetation productivity, which may raise issues of water availability and crop production.},

The latest modeling efforts indicate that coastal and underwater topography are important generation sites for submesoscale coherent vortices (SCVs), characterized by horizontal scales of O (0:1-10) km. Using idealized, sub-mesoscale and bottom boundary layer (BBL)-resolving simulations and adopting an integrated vorticity balance formu-lation, we quantify precisely the role of BBLs in the vorticity generation process. In particular, we show that vorticity generation on topographic slopes is attributable primarily to the torque exerted by the vertical divergence of stress at the bottom. We refer to this as the bottom stress divergence torque (BSDT). BSDT is a fundamentally nonconservative torque that appears as a source term in the integrated vorticity budget and is to be distinguished from the more familiar bottom stress curl (BSC). It is closely connected to the bottom pressure torque (BPT) via the horizontal momentum balance at the bottom and is in fact shown to be the dominant component of BPT in solutions with a well-resolved BBL. This suggests an interpretation of BPT as the sum of a viscous, vorticity-generating component (BSDT) and an inviscid, ``flow-turning'' component. Companion simulations without bottom drag illustrate that although vorticity generation can still occur through the inviscid mechanisms of vortex stretching and tilting, the wake eddies tend to have weaker circulation, be substantially less energetic, and have smaller spatial scales.},

  abstract = {The Galapagos Cold Pool (GCP) is a region of anomalously cold sea surface temperature (SST) just west of the Galipagos Archipelago. Modeling studies have shown that the GCP is maintained by wind- and current-driven upwelling. The Galapagos Archipelago lies on the equator, in the path of the Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) as it flows eastward across the Pacific at the depth of the thermocline. It is hypothesized that the EUC upwells into the GCP as it reaches the topographical barrier of the Galapagos Archipelago. The path of the EUC in the vicinity of the archipelago is not well understood. The 'Repeat Ob- servations by Gliders in the Equatorial Region' (ROGER) program deployed a fleet of Spray autonomous underwater gliders in the region just west of the Galapagos Archipelago from 2013 - 2016 with the goal of continuously occupying three transects that form a closed area, with the archipelago as the eastern boundary. Gliders obtained subsurface measurements of temperature, salinity, and velocity with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. These measurements are used to observe the path of the EUC as it bifurcates into a north and south branch around the Galapagos Archipelago. Net horizontal transport into the volume defined by the closed area formed by the glider transects is used to estimate an average vertical velocity profile in the region of the GCP, indicating upwelling in the upper 300 m. The bifurcation latitude of the EUC, estimated to be approximately 0.4\textdegree S from volume transport as a function of salinity, is coincident with the meridional center of the archipelago, suggesting the bifurcation latitude is topographically controlled. Ertel poten- tial vorticity and a Bernoulli function are qualitatively conserved, supporting an inertial model of the EUC. Average spectral variance from Argo profiling float observations is used to show that tropical instability waves propagate with frequency and wavelength consistent with linearized, equatorial \#-plane model results and may impact the GCP, according to their vertical structure.

  abstract = {The Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) encounters the Gal\'apagos Archipelago on the equator as it flows eastward across the Pacific. The impact of the Gal\'apagosArchipelago on the EUC in the eastern equatorial Pacific remains largely unknown. In this study, the path of the EUC as it reaches the Gal\'apagos Archipelago is measured directly using high-resolution observations obtained by autonomous underwater gliders. Gliderswere deployed along three lines that define a closed region with the Gal\'apagosArchipelago as the eastern boundary and 93\textdegree W from 2\textdegree S to 2\textdegree N as the western boundary. Twelve transects were simultaneously occupied along the three lines during 52 days in April-May 2016. Analysis of individual glider transects and average sections along each line show that the EUC splits around the Gal\'apagos Archipelago. Velocity normal to the transects is used to estimate net horizontal volume transport into the volume. Downward integration of the net horizontal transport profile provides an estimate of the time- and areal-averaged vertical velocity profile over the 52-day time period. Local maxima in vertical velocity occur at depths of 25 and 280 m with magnitudes of (1.7 {$\pm$} 0.6) x 10-5 ms-1 and (8.0 {$\pm$} 1.6) x 10-5 ms-1, respectively. Volume transport as a function of salinity indicates that water crossing 93\textdegree W south (north) of 0.4\textdegree S tends to flow around the south (north) side of the Gal\'apagos Archipelago. Comparisons are made between previous observational and modeling studies with differences attributed to effects of the strong 2015/16 El Ni\~no event, the annual cycle of local winds, and varying longitudes between studies of the equatorial Pacific.},

The focus of the study is on explainingthe generationmechanismsof the rings and their vertical structure.The OGCM is used in a con\'eguration simpli\'eed as much as possible but capable of reproducinga realistic mean circulationof the tropical Atlantic. Three numerical experiments are analyzed: no wind; steady wind; seasonally varying winds. With wind forcing, a consistent scenario emerges for the generationof NBC rings. It is shown \'erst that the NECC is barotropicallyunstable, radiatingRossbywaves of the \'erst baroclinicmode with a period of 63 days (steady wind) or 50 days (variable wind). These waves re\`eect at the Brazilian coast and create about 6\textendash 7 anticyclones per year. These anticyclones intensify as they propagate north- westward along the Brazilian coast because of potential vorticity conservation and become NBC rings. Among them, about one per year reaches a depth below 1000 m. These deep rings are created by the merger of a surface NBC ring with an intermediate eddy. The intermediate eddies are produced by the Intermediate Western Boundary Current (IWBC) which becomes unstable upon crossing equation are energetic, Fofonoff-like, and nearly steady. If, on the other hand, the wind opposes Fofonoff flow, the wind-driven solutions are turbulent, with small mean flows, and much less energy. Our results suggest that integral conservation laws (on which the equilibrium statistical mechanics is solely based) largely define the role of the nonlinearities this viewpoint, we demonstrate in the quasigeostrophic equation. To support a resemblance between the solutions of the quasigeostrophic equation and the solutions of a stochastic model equation. The stochastic model equation, in which the advected vorticity is replaced by a random variable, has only gross conservation laws in common with the quasigeostrophic equation.},

  abstract = {Near the western boundary of the tropical North Atlantic, where the North Brazil Current (NBC) retroflects into the North Equatorial Countercurrent, large anticyclonic rings are shed. After separating from the retroflection region, the so-called NBC rings travel northwestward along the Brazilian coast, until they reach the island chain of the Lesser Antilles and disintegrate. These rings contribute substantially to the upper limb return flow of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation by carrying South Atlantic Water into the northern subtropical gyre. Their relevance for the northward transport of South Atlantic Water depends on the frequency of their generation as well as on their horizontal and vertical structure. The ring shedding and propagation and the complex interaction of the rings with the Lesser Antilles are investigated in the 1/12\textdegree{} Family of Linked Atlantic Model Experiments (FLAME) model. The ring properties simulated in FLAME reach the upper limit of the observed rings in diameter and agree with recent observations on seasonal variability, which indicates a maximum shedding during the first half of the year. When the rings reach the shallow topography of the Lesser Antilles, they are trapped by the island triangle of St. Lucia, Barbados and Tobago and interact with the island chain. The model provides a resolution that is capable of resolving the complex topographic conditions at the islands and illuminates various possible fates for the water contained in the rings. It also reproduces laboratory experiments that indicate that both cyclones and anticyclones are formed after a ring passes through a topographic gap. Trajectories of artificial floats, which were inserted into the modeled velocity field, are used to investigate the pathways of the ring cores and their fate after they encounter the Lesser Antilles. The majority of the floats entered the Caribbean, while the northward Atlantic pathway was found to be of minor importance. No prominent pathway was found east of Barbados, where a ring could avoid the interaction with the islands and migrate toward the northern Lesser Antilles undisturbed.

  abstract = {Current meter observations from an array of three subsurface moorings located on the Brazil continental slope near 4\textdegree N are used to describe the annual cycle and low-frequency variability of the North Brazil Current (NBC). The moored array was deployed from September 1989 to January 1991, with further extension of the shallowest mooring, located over the 500-m isobath near the axis of the NBC, through September 1991. Moored current measurements were also obtained over the adjacent shelf for a limited time between February and May 1990. The NBC has a large annual cycle at this latitude, ranging from a maximum transport of 36 Sv (Sv {$\equiv$} 106 m3 s-1) in July-August to a minimum of 13 Sv in April-May, with an annual mean transport of approximately 26 Sv. The mean transport is dominated by flow in the upper 150 m, and the seasonal cycle is contained almost entirely in the top 300 m. Transport over the continental shelf is 3-5 Sv and appears to be fairly constant throughout the year, based on the available current meter records and shipboard ADCP surveys. The NBC transport cycle is in good agreement with linear wind-driven models and appears to be in near-equilibrium with remote wind stress curl forcing across the tropical Atlantic for much of the year. However, the mean transport of the NBC is 15 Sv larger than can be explained by wind forcing alone, indicating a strong thermohaline component. Mesoscale variability in the region is dominated by fluctuations with periods near 25-40 days and 60-90 days. The 25-40-day fluctuations are strongly surface trapped and are most energetic in early summer during the acceleration phase of the NBC. The lower-frequency fluctuations have a deeper reaching baroclinic structure, are present year-round, and are associated with the propagation of large anticyclonic eddies northwestward along the coast. It is hypothesized that these features may serve as a catalyst for the eddy shedding process seen in the NBC retroflection in earlier observations.},

  abstract = {[1] Recent climate model experiments, as well as paleoclimate records, suggest that the meridional overturning circulation or "thermohaline circulation'' in the Atlantic Ocean could change abruptly as a result of global warming, and that this could have a significant impact on European climate. We use a reduced-gravity model to investigate the response of the Atlantic overturning circulation to changes in forcing. We find that variability at decadal and higher frequencies is confined to a single hemisphere. This implies that (a) overturning variability resulting from high frequency changes in buoyancy forcing in the Labrador and Greenland Seas will be limited to the North Atlantic, and (b) any observed decadal and higher frequency fluctuations in North Atlantic overturning can only result from changes in the surface fluxes within the North Atlantic basin itself. These results suggest that Southern Ocean wind forcing is not important for North Atlantic overturning on decadal and shorter timescales.},

  abstract = {The response of the upper, warm limb of the thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic to a rapid change in deep-water formation at high latitudes is investigated using a reduced-gravity ocean model. Changes in deep-water formation rate initiate Kelvin waves that propagate along the western boundary to the equator on a timescale of months. The response in the North Atlantic is therefore rapid. The Southern Hemisphere response is much slower, limited by a mechanism here termed the "equatorial buffer.'' Since to leading order the flow is in geostrophic balance, the pressure anomaly decreases in magnitude as the Kelvin wave moves equatorward, where the Coriolis parameter is lower. Together with the lack of sustained pressure gradients along the eastern boundary, this limits the size of the pressure field response in the Southern Hemisphere. Interior adjustment is by the westward propagation of Rossby waves, but only a small fraction of the change in thermohaline circulation strength is communicated across the equator to the South Atlantic at any one time, introducing a much longer timescale into the system.A new quantitative theory is developed to explain this long-timescale adjustment. The theory relates the westward propagation of thermocline depth anomalies to the net meridional transport and leads to a "delay equation'' in a single parameter- the thermocline depth on the eastern boundary-from which the time-varying circulation in the entire basin can be calculated. The theory agrees favorably with the numerical results. Implications for predictability, abrupt climate change, and the monitoring of thermohaline variability are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract There is a wide range of evidence from both models and palaeoclimatic data that indicates the possibility of abrupt changes in the oceanic meridional overturning circulation (MOC). However, much of our dynamical understanding of the MOC comes from steady-state models that rely upon the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium and are therefore only valid on millennial time scales. Here a dynamical model for the global teleconnections of MOC anomalies on annual to multidecadal time scales is developed. It is based on a linear theory for the propagation of zonally integrated meridional transport anomalies in a reduced-gravity ocean and allows for multiple ocean basins connected by a circumpolar channel to the south. The theory demonstrates that the equator acts as a low-pass filter to MOC anomalies. As a consequence, MOC anomalies on decadal and shorter time scales are confined to the hemispheric basin in which they are generated and have little impact on the remainder of the global ocean.

Theoretical models have also changed our view of the AMOC, providing a dynamical framework for understanding the new observations and the results of complex models. In this paper we review recent theoretical advances in conceptual understanding of the processes maintaining the AMOC. We discuss recent theoretical models that address issues such as the interplay between surface buoyancy and wind forcing, the extent to which the AMOC is adiabatic, the importance of mesoscale eddies, the interaction between the mid-depth North Atlantic Deep Water cell and the abyssal Antarctic Bottom Water cell, the role of basin geometry and bathymetry, and the importance of a three-dimensional multiple-basin perspective. We review new paradigms for deep water formation in the high-latitude North Atlantic and the impact of diapycnal mixing on vertical motion in the ocean interior. And we discuss advances in our understanding of the AMOC's stability and its scaling with large scale meridional density gradients. Along with reviewing theories for the mean AMOC, we consider models of AMOC variability, and discuss what we have learned from theory about the detection and meridional propagation of AMOC anomalies. Simple theoretical models remain a vital and powerful tool for articulating our understanding of the AMOC and identifying the processes that are most critical to represent accurately in the next generation of numerical ocean and climate models.},

This inhibits northwestward transport next to the Amazon River plume. In the downstream zone, the Labrador Current feeds low saline Arctic waters into the Gulf Stream, inducing an equatorward shift and reduced flow. Evidence is growing for spin-down of the North Atlantic gyre and its feeder currents, that inhibit poleward heat exchange and contribute to climatic shifts. Eastward trends of winds and currents in the equatorial Atlantic is projected to bring a drier climate to the lower Amazon basin and southeastern Caribbean, hence greater salinity with knock-on effects for regional sea temperatures.}

  abstract = {A linear, two-layer baroclinic model of deep circulation driven by deep water production is formulated. In distinction to the Stommel-Arons model where a uniform middepth upwelling is prescribed, the present model determines upwelling internally by inclusion of a Newtonian damping term in the continuity equation. Analytical solutions for the steady state are derived using the equatorial beta-plane approximation, which show that the coefficient of damping in the upwelling term determines the nature of the flow. With a large damping coefficient, the deep western boundary current from the deep-water source region does not cross the equator, but rather separates along it. The current reaches the eastern boundary and then flows poleward in both hemispheres as an eastern boundary current. In the limit of very weak damping, the flow spins up to the Stommel-Arons state, with the western boundary current crossing the equator and with poleward flows in the interior. Numerical experiments on the spherical coordinates confirm the results of analytical theory for the steady state. They also show that the flow is first set up by a Kelvin wave along the western-equatorial-eastern boundary layers; then, in the case of weak damping, the eastern boundary current disperses as long Rossby waves to set up the poleward interior flow of the Stommel-Arons model.},

  abstract = {Inertial instability in parallel shear flows and circular vortices in a uniformly rotating system ( f-plane) redistributes absolute linear momentum or absolute angular momentum in such a way as to neutralize the instability. In previous studies we showed that, in the absence of other instabilities, at high Reynolds numbers the final equilibrium can be predicted with a simple construction based on conservation of total momentum. In this paper we continue this line of research with a study of barotropic shear flows on the equatorial {$\beta$}-plane. Through numerical simulations the evolution of the instability is studied in select illuminating cases: a westward flowing Gaussian jet with the flow axis exactly on the equator, a uniform shear flow and eastward and westward flowing jets that have their flow axis shifted away from the equator. In the numerical simulations it is assumed that there are no along-stream variations. This suppresses equatorial Rossby waves and barotropic shear instabilities and allows only inertial instability to develop. We investigate whether for these flows on the equatorial {$\beta$}-plane the final equilibrated flow can be predicted as was possible for flows on the f-plane. For the Gaussian jet centred on the equator the prediction of the equilibrated flow is obvious by mere inspection of the initial momentum distribution and by assuming that momentum is mixed and homogenized to render the equilibrated flow inertially stable. For the uniform shear flow, however, due to the peculiar nature of the initial momentum distribution and the fact that the Coriolis parameter f varies with latitude, it appears that, unlike in our earlier studies of flows on the f-plane, additional constraints need to be considered to correctly predict the outcome of the highly nonlinear evolution of the instability. The mixing range of the linear shear flow and the value of the mixed momentum is determined numerically and this is used to predict the equilibrated flow that emerges from an eastward flowing jet that is shifted a small distance away from the equator. For shifts large enough to induce no shear at the equator the equilibrium flow can be well predicted using the simple recipe used in our earlier studies of parallel shear flows on the f-plane. For the westward flowing jet shifted a very small distance from the equator, no prediction appears feasible. For modestly small shifts a prediction is possible by combining the empirical prediction for the linear shear flow with a prediction similar to what we used in our previous studies for flows on the f-plane},

  abstract = {If model parameterizations of unresolved physics, such as the variety of upper ocean mixing processes, are to hold over the large range of time and space scales of importance to climate, they must be strongly physically based. Observations, theories, and models of oceanic vertical mixing are surveyed. Two distinct regimes are identified: ocean mixing in the boundary layer near the surface under a variety of surface forcing conditions (stabilizing, destabilizing, and wind driven), and mixing in the ocean interior due to internal waves, shear instability, and double diffusion (arising from the different molecular diffusion rates of heat and salt). Mixing schemes commonly applied to the upper ocean are shown not to contain some potentially important boundary layer physics. Therefore a new parameterization of oceanic boundary layer mixing is developed to accommodate some of this physics. It includes a scheme for determining the boundary layer depth h, where the turbulent contribution to the vertical shear of a bulk Richardson number is parameterized. Expressions for diffusivity and nonlocal transport throughout the boundary layer are given. The diffusivity is formulated to agree with similarity theory of turbulence in the surface layer and is subject to the conditions that both it and its vertical gradient match the interior values at h. This nonlocal ``K profile parameterization'' (KPP) is then verified and compared to alternatives, including its atmospheric counterparts. Its most important feature is shown to be the capability of the boundary layer to penetrate well into a stable thermocline in both convective and wind-driven situations. The diffusivities of the aforementioned three interior mixing processes are modeled as constants, functions of a gradient Richardson number (a measure of the relative importance of stratification to destabilizing shear), and functions of the double-diffusion density ratio, R{$\rho$}. Oceanic simulations of convective penetration, wind deepening, and diurnal cycling are used to determine appropriate values for various model parameters as weak functions of vertical resolution. Annual cycle simulations at ocean weather station Papa for 1961 and 1969\textendash 1974 are used to test the complete suite of parameterizations. Model and observed temperatures at all depths are shown to agree very well into September, after which systematic advective cooling in the ocean produces expected differences. It is argued that this cooling and a steady salt advection into the model are needed to balance the net annual surface heating and freshwater input. With these advections, good multiyear simulations of temperature and salinity can be achieved. These results and KPP simulations of the diurnal cycle at the Long-Term Upper Ocean Study (LOTUS) site are compared with the results of other models. It is demonstrated that the KPP model exchanges properties between the mixed layer and thermocline in a manner consistent with observations, and at least as well or better than alternatives.},

The propensity to develop turbulence and mixing due to vertical shear over intense stabilizing density gradients is an important characteristic of such environments. For the first time, microscale measurements were made in the Brazil Current-Intermediate Western Boundary Current system, providing direct quantitative values of the turbulent fluctuations. Peaks of relative strong dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy (O(10-8)W/kg) were observed close to the base of the surface mixed layer. On the other hand, prominent peaks of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates of up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than the background were observed at deeper levels, where stratification begins to lose intensity. Analyzing such peaks, caused by intense vertical shear or weak stratification\textemdash and sometimes both\textemdash, allows a characterization of the local mixing processes and the role played by vertical exchanges of biogeochemical properties. Based on the estimated nitrate gradient and the vertical diffusivity, we show that turbulent mixing driven by vertical shear plays an important role in the supply of nitrate to the upper layer.},

We consider different types of circular barotropic vortices in a linearly stratified shallow layer confined with rigid lids. For the simplest case of the Rankine vortex we develop an asymptotic analytic dispersion relation and a marginal stability criterion, which compares well with numerical results. This is a further generalization to the well-known generalized Rayleigh criterion, which is only valid for non-dissipative and non-stratified eddies. Unlike the Rayleigh criterion, it predicts that intense anticyclones may be stable even with a core region of negative absolute vorticity, and that the dissipation and stratification work together to stabilize the flow. Numerical analysis reveals that the stability diagrams for various types of vortices are almost identical in the Rossby, Burger and Ekman parameter space. This allows extension of our analytical solutions for the Rankine vortex to a wide variety of vortices. Furthermore, we show that a more suitable parameter for the intensity of the vortex is the vortex Rossby number, while for the inviscid case it is the local normalized vorticity. These predictions are in agreement with laboratory experiments presented in part 2 (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 732, 2013, pp. 485-509).},

  abstract = {The subpolar North Atlantic is a site of significant carbon dioxide, oxygen, and heat exchange with the atmosphere. This exchange, which regulates transient climate change and prevents large-scale hypoxia throughout the North Atlantic, is thought to be mediated by vertical mixing in the ocean's surface mixed layer. Here we present observational evidence that waters deeper than the conventionally defined mixed layer are affected directly by atmospheric forcing in this region. When northerly winds blow along the Irminger Sea's western boundary current, the Ekman response pushes denser water over lighter water, potentially triggering slantwise convection. We estimate that this down-front wind forcing is four times stronger than air\textendash sea heat flux buoyancy forcing and can mix waters to several times the conventionally defined mixed layer depth. Slantwise convection is not included in most large-scale ocean models, which likely limits their ability to accurately represent subpolar water mass transformations and deep ocean ventilation.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Sea surface salinity (SSS) data derived from the Aquarius/SAC-D satellite mission are analyzed along with other satellite and in situ data to assess Aquarius' capability to detect tropical instability waves (TIWs) and eddies in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and to investigate the influence that SSS has on the variability. Aquarius data show that the magnitude of SSS anomalies associated with the Atlantic TIWs is {$\pm$}0.25 practical salinity unit, which is weaker than those in the Pacific by 50\%. In the central equatorial Atlantic, SSS contribution to the mean meridional density gradient is similar to sea surface temperature (SST) contribution. Consequently, SSS is important to TIW-related surface density anomalies and perturbation potential energy (PPE). In this region, SSS influences surface PPE significantly through the direct effect and the indirect effect associated with SSS-SST covariability. Ignoring SSS effects would underestimate TIW-related PPE by approximately three times in the surface layer. SSS also regulates the seasonality of the TIWs. The boreal-spring peak of the PPE due to SSS leads that due to SST by about one month. Therefore, SSS not only affects the spatial structure, but the seasonal variability of the TIWs in the equatorial Atlantic. In the northeast Atlantic near the Amazon outflow and the North Brazil Current retroflection region and in the southeast Atlantic near the Congo River outflow, SSS accounts for 80-90\% of the contribution to mean meridional density gradient. Not accounting for SSS effect would underestimate surface PPE in these regions by a factor of 10 and 4, respectively.}

Four types of equatorially trapped waves were identified which dominate the variability of the circulation: an annual Rossby wave, a semiannual Rossby wave, a group of 40- to 60-day short Rossby waves, and a group of 30-day Yanai waves. In particular, the 40- to 60-day short Rossby waves were found near the western boundary to the north of the equator, which may be related to nonlinear instability processes associated with the north Brazil current (NBC) retroflection. The wave-induced stirring and transport along the equator was investigated by calculating the trajectories of a large ensemble of particles in the middepth equatorial Atlantic Ocean from the eddy-resolving, model-simulated velocity field. The distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents derived from the simulated velocity at a depth of {$\sim$}2000 m bears a close resemblence to the observed CFC tongue, suggesting that the wave-induced chaotic stirring and transport may contribute to the formation of the observed CFC tongue in the middepth equatorial Atlantic Ocean along the equator.

  abstract = {Scientific and societal interest in the relationship between the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and U.S. East Coast sea level has intensified over the past decade, largely due to (1) projected, and potentially ongoing, enhancement of sea level rise associated with AMOC weakening and (2) the potential for observations of U.S. East Coast sea level to inform reconstructions of North Atlantic circulation and climate. These implications have inspired a wealth of model- and observation-based analyses. Here, we review this research, finding consistent support in numerical models for an antiphase relationship between AMOC strength and dynamic sea level. However, simulations exhibit substantial along-coast and intermodel differences in the amplitude of AMOC-associated dynamic sea level variability. Observational analyses focusing on shorter (generally less than decadal) timescales show robust relationships between some components of the North Atlantic large-scale circulation and coastal sea level variability, but the causal relationships between different observational metrics, AMOC, and sea level are often unclear. We highlight the importance of existing and future research seeking to understand relationships between AMOC and its component currents, the role of ageostrophic processes near the coast, and the interplay of local and remote forcing. Such research will help reconcile the results of different numerical simulations with each other and with observations, inform the physical origins of covariability, and reveal the sensitivity of scaling relationships to forcing, timescale, and model representation. This information will, in turn, provide a more complete characterization of uncertainty in relevant relationships, leading to more robust reconstructions and projections. Plain Language Summary Sea level along the U.S. East Coast is influenced by changes in the density and currents of the North Atlantic Ocean. Indeed, there are simple theoretical considerations that relate indices of basin-scale flow to coastal sea level. Such a relationship could be leveraged to predict future sea level changes and coastal flooding given an expected change in climate and ocean circulation. Alternatively, it could be used to reconstruct ocean circulation from sea level measurements. This paper reviews the nature of this relationship and whether, and when, it is evident in climate models and observations. Although the current generation of large-scale climate and ocean models generally show an antiphase relationship between basin-scale ocean current strength and coastal sea level, the spatial pattern of sea level change differs from theory and between models. Supported by existing and emerging research, the authors hypothesize that these deviations result from important physical processes occurring on the continental shelf and slope, and the complexities of the 3-dimensional ocean circulation. A quantitative assessment of the importance of these processes is critical for understanding past and future climate and sea level changes in this heavily populated and vulnerable region.},

The general equation of steady-state motion derived in Part I is integrated to yield the flow of a stratified fluid over an obstacle of finite dimensions. The results indicate a more or less complicated laminar wave motion for obstacles of maximum height below a certain value. Larger barriers cause an overdevelopment of the waves to a point where closed circulations and negative horizontal velocities appear. It is shown that this is accompanied by locally unstable distributions of density and eventual turbulence. If the height of the barrier is further increased, the velocity increases indefinitely in some parts of the field, becoming infinite for an obstacle of a certain size. No steady-state solution exists for larger barriers. The two critical values of the obstacle height depend primarily on the Froude number: If this number exceeds 1/{$\pi$} the solution exists and is stable for all obstacles; for small Froude numbers the barrier must be small if the solution is to exist or be stable. If the obstacle is small enough to permit laminar or moderately turbulent motion, the accompanying experiments verify all important features of the theory with remarkable fidelity. Larger obstacles cause considerable turbulence and blocking effects which propagate upstream, causing alternate maxima (jets) and minima of horizontal velocity in the vertical.},

Features of the time-mean circulation and its seasonal variations are resolved at unprecedented scales, for both total and Ekman-removed velocities. The drifter observations reveal the branches of the South Equatorial Current (SEC) which merge with the North Brazil Current (NBC), correlated annual fluctuations in the strengths of the NBC retroflection, western North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) and SEC, and flow along the Guyana Coast, and strong semiannual variations in the equatorial band of the central basin. Conduits are traced which link seasonal variations of the equatorial current system's strength with the northern and southern hemisphere subtropical gyres. These findings update key results of the two decade old SEQUAL/FOCAL programs, and allow generation of a new monthly climatology of near-surface currents in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.}

It shows that the dynamic response of the equatorial western boundary of the Atlantic Ocean to either a remote forcing which is represented by an incoming Rossby wave packet that deepens the equatorial thermocline, or to the wind forcing over the tropical Atlantic Ocean can result in northwestward translating eddies up the coast of Brazil. The numerically simulated eddies closely resemble the features of the observed North Brazil Current retroflection eddies. The formation mechanism of these eddies has to do with the short equatorial Rossby waves (which can be generated by the said kinds of forcing), nonlinearity, and the boundary effect. The translation mechanism of these eddies is related to the nonlinear effect caused by the eddies' interaction with the boundary and to the variation of the Coriolis parameter with latitude.}

  abstract = {The authors study the stability of a barotropic sinusoidal meridional flow on a {$\beta$} plane. Because of bottom drag and lateral viscosity, the system is dissipative and forcing maintains a basic-state velocity that carries fluid across the planetary vorticity contours; this is a simple model of forced potential vorticity mixing. When the Reynolds number is slightly above the stability threshold, a perturbation expansion can be used to obtain an amplitude equation for the most unstable disturbances. These instabilities are zonal flows with a much larger length scale than that of the basic state. Numerical and analytic considerations show that random initial perturbations rapidly reorganize into a set of fast and narrow eastward jets separated by slower and broader regions of westward flow. There then follows a much slower adjustment of the jets, involving gradual meridional migration and merger. Because of the existence of a Lyapunov functional for the dynamics, this one-dimensional inverse cascade ultimately settles into a steady solution. For a fixed {$\beta$}, the meridional separation of the eastward jets depends on the bottom drag. When the bottom drag is zero, the process of jet merger proceeds very slowly to completion until only one jet is left in the domain. For small bottom drag, the steady-state meridional separation of the jets varies as (bottom drag)-1/3. Varying the nondimensional {$\beta$} parameter can change the instability from supercritical (when {$\beta$} is small) to subcritical (when {$\beta$} is larger). Thus, the system has a rich phenomenology involving multiple stable solutions, hysteritic transitions, and so on.},

  abstract = {Submesoscale dynamics in tropical instability waves (TIWs) of the Pacific ocean are analyzed from nested numerical simulations of increasing resolution (36km, 12km, and 4km). It is shown that numerical convergence, as determined by an invariance of the kinetic energy (KE) spectrum with resolution, can be obtained for grid spacing around 10km. This finding contrasts with mid-latitude simulations of submesoscale processes that do not converge even for grid spacing less than 1km. The difference is associated with the larger Rossby radius of deformation at low latitudes due to the weaker Coriolis parameter. For the same reason, the mixed layer Rossby radius is larger as well, resulting in submesoscale mixed layer eddies (MLEs) with scales of 50-200km. Similar to MLEs at mid-latitudes, those eddies that form at TIW fronts restratify the mixed layer by releasing available potential energy. They lead to an additional source of KE at submesoscale that is larger in the finer resolution simulations. At wavelengths smaller than the mesoscale peak of KE injection, a forward cascade of KE is evident in the simulations where three dynamical ranges are observed: a quasi-inertial range of slope k-2, a pre-dissipation range and a far-dissipation range. Numerical dissipation is evaluated and significant dissipation is found to occur in a pre-dissipation range, i.e., for wavenumbers well below the range where the KE spectrum tails off exponentially. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The PV flux lines can either close on themselves (recirculation) or begin and end on the boundaries (ventilation). Idealized thermocline solutions are diagnosed using J vectors, which vividly illustrate the competing process of recirculation through western boundary currents and subduction from the surface.

Such a surface might be the base of the oceanic mixed layer or, in a meteorological context, the tropopause.

  abstract = {The numerical implementation of an ocean model based on the incompressible Navier Stokes equations which is designed for studies of the ocean circulation on horizontal scales less than the depth of the ocean right up to global scale is described. A "pressure correction" method is used which is solved as a Poisson equation for the pressure field with Neumann boundary conditions in a geometry as complicated as that of the ocean basins. A major objective of the study is to make this inversion, and hence nonhydrostatic ocean modeling, efficient on parallel computers. The pressure field is separated into surface, hydrostatic, and nonhydrostatic components. First, as in hydrostatic models, a two-dimensional problem is inverted for the surface pressure which is then made use of in the three-dimensional inversion for the nonhydrostatic pressure. Preconditioned conjugate-gradient iteration is used to invert symmetric elliptic operators in both two and three dimensions. Physically motivated preconditioners are designed which are efficient at reducing computation and minimizing communication between processors. Our method exploits the fact that as the horizontal scale of the motion becomes very much larger than the vertical scale, the motion becomes more and more hydrostatic and the three-dimensional Poisson operator becomes increasingly anisotropic and dominated by the vertical axis. Accordingly, a preconditioner is used which, in the hydrostatic limit, is an exact integral of the Poisson operator and so leads to a single algorithm that seamlessly moves from nonhydrostatic to hydrostatic limits. Thus in the hydrostatic limit the model is "fast," competitive with the fastest ocean climate models in use today based on the hydrostatic primitive equations. But as the resolution is increased, the model dynamics asymptote smoothly to the Navier Stokes equations and so can be used to address small-scale processes. A "finite-volume" approach is employed to discretize the model in space in which property fluxes are defined normal to faces that delineate the volumes. The method makes possible a novel treatment of the boundary in which cells abutting the bottom or coast may take on irregular shapes and be "shaved" to fit the boundary. The algorithm can conveniently exploit massively parallel computers and suggests a domain decomposition which allocates vertical columns of ocean to each processing unit. The resulting model, which can handle arbitrarily complex geometry, is efficient and scalable and has been mapped on to massively parallel multiprocessors such as the Connection Machine (CM5) using data-parallel FORTRAN and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology data-flow machine MONSOON using the implicitly parallel language Id.

Observational, laboratory, and modeling studies reveal a fascinating and complex interplay of convective and geostrophic scales, the large-scale circulation of the ocean, and the prevailing meteorology. Two aspects make ocean convection interesting from a theoretical point of view. First, the timescales of the convective process in the ocean are sufficiently long that it may be modified by the Earth's rotation; second, the convective process is localized in space so that vertical buoyancy transfer by upright convection can give way to slantwise transfer by baroclinic instability. Moreover, the convective and geostrophic scales are not very disparate from one another. Detailed observations of the process in the Labrador, Greenland, and Mediterranean Seas are described, which were made possible by new observing technology. When interpreted in terms of underlying dynamics and theory and the context provided by laboratory and numerical experiments of rotating convection, great progress in our description and understanding of the processes at work is being made.},

  abstract = {When a force is applied to the ocean, fluid parcels are accelerated both locally, by the applied force, and nonlocally, by the pressure gradient forces established to maintain continuity and satisfy the kinematic boundary condition. The net acceleration can be represented through a ``rotational force'' in the rotational component of the momentum equation. This approach elucidates the correspondence between momentum and vorticity descriptions of the large-scale ocean circulation: if two terms balance pointwise in the rotational momentum equation, then the equivalent two terms balance pointwise in the vorticity equation. The utility of the approach is illustrated for three classical problems: barotropic Rossby waves, wind-driven circulation in a homogeneous basin, and the meridional overturning circulation in an interhemispheric basin. In the hy- drostatic limit, it is shown that the rotational forces further decompose into depth-integrated forces that drive the wind-driven gyres and overturning forces that are confined to the basin boundaries and drive the over- turning circulation. Potential applications of the approach to diagnosing the output of ocean circulation models, alternative and more accurate formulations of numerical ocean models, the dynamics of boundary layer separation, and eddy forcing of the large-scale ocean circulation are discussed. 1.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the adjustment of the meridional overturning circulation to localized forcing, solutions are presented from a reduced-gravity model for the propagation of waves along western and eastern boundaries. For wave periods exceeding a few months, Kelvin waves play no role. Instead, propagation occurs through short and long Rossby waves at the western and eastern boundaries, respectively: these Rossby wave spropagate zonally, as predicted by classical theory, and cyclonically along the basin boundaries to satisfy the no-normal flow boundary condition. The along-boundary propagation speed is cLd/{$\delta$}, where c is the internal gravity/Kelvin wave speed, Ld is the Rossby deformation radius, and d is the appropriate frictional boundary layer width. This result holds across a wide range of parameter regimes, with either linear friction or lateral viscosity and a no-slip boundary condition. For parameters typical of contemporary ocean climate models, the propagation speed is coincidentally close to the Kelvin wave speed. In the limit of weak dissipation, the western boundary wave dissipates virtually all of its energy as it propagates toward the equator, independent of the dissipation coefficient. In contrast, virtually no energy is dissipated in the eastern boundary wave. The importance of background mean flows is also discussed. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

Very few Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) include runoff which brings a specific contribution to the Ocean physics. Comparison of simulations with constant or monthly runoffs shows that the spread of the Amazon fresh waters offshore of the north Brazilian coast is controlled by the ocean circulation and not by the Amazon flow. Therefore, in the model like in the observations, SSS minimum is observed in summer three months after the Amazon flood. In agreement with observations, a thick (more than 40 m) Barrier Layer (BL) is present every summer north of the Amazon mouth. Because of the strong and shallow salinity gradient associated with the Amazon fresh water, an important part of the solar radiation is trapped in the BL and creates an inversion of the vertical gradient of temperature. However with this forced model, BL does not seem to have a clear impact on SST and so on the air-sea interaction. Freshwater flux is also able to bend the sea surface. The geostrophic part of the North Brazilian Current (NBC) retroflection is then lightly weaker in presence of the Amazon runoff. \textcopyright{} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}

Oceanic fronts are abundant in the CCS, and are known to be associated with coastal upwelling. Analyses of satellite observations (altimetry and sea surface temperature, SST) of the CCS highlight the presence of SST fronts in the southern part of the CCS outside of the coastal upwelling season, which will be investigated. The submesoscale-permitting and tidal-resolving LLC4320-simulation was used to analyze the nature of these features, through the study of the surface density gradients, the vertical velocities and the horizontal strain. An algorithm was also developed to track SST fronts in the model. The classical scenario of coastal upwelling is confirmed in the central CCS (off California), with a strain field correlated to vertical velocities associated with the SST fronts, and collocated density fronts. In contrast, in the southern CCS (off Baja California), vertical velocities were much weaker and density gradients were not always observed where SST fronts were detected, leading to the assumption that the fronts there may be affected by thermohaline compensation occurring in the region. These findings confirm the existence of SST fronts in the CCS outside of the traditional coastal upwelling framework, with part of the fronts in the southern CCS being passive and advected by the background flow.},

  abstract = {Earth's atmosphere and oceans exhibit complex patterns of fluid motion over a vast range of space and time scales. On the planetary scale they combine to establish the climate in response to solar radiation that is inhomogeneously absorbed by the materials comprising air, water, and land. Spontaneous, energetic variability arises from instabilities in the planetary-scale circulations, appearing in many different forms such as waves, jets, vortices, boundary layers, and turbulence. Geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) is the science of all these types of fluid motion. It seeks to identify and analyze the essential dynamical processes that lie behind observed phenomena. As with any other theoretical science of complex nonlinear dynamics, mathematical analysis and computational modeling are essential research methodologies, and there is a continuing search for more powerful, accurate, and efficient techniques. This book is an introduction to GFD for readers interested in do- ing research in the physics, chemistry, and/or biology of Earth's fluid environment. It is a product of teaching a first-year graduate course at the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for many years. It is only an intro- duction to the subject; additional, more specialized GFD courses are required to fully prepare for practicing research in the subject. Never- theless, to stimulate students' enthusiasm, the contents are a mixture of rudimentary mathematical analyses and somewhat complex dynami- cal outcomes. Students in this course are expected to be familiar with physics and mathematics at the level of general dynamics (mechanics) and partial differential equations. In the present graduate curriculum at UCLA, students are first exposed to one course on basic fluid dynamics and thermodynamics and another course on the principal phenomena 6Preface 7 of winds and currents and their underlying conceptual models. This background comprises the starting point for the book. GFD is a mature subject, having had its adolescence in the mid- dle of the last century. Consequently many meritorious books already exist. Most of them are specialized in their material, but several of the more general ones are usefully complementary to this book, e.g., Cushman-Roisin (1994), Gill (1982), Holton (2004), Pedlosky (1987), Salmon (1998), and Stern (1975).},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 American Meteorological Society. The intra-annual variability of the tropical Atlantic Ocean north of the equator is investigated with satellite altimetry mean sea level anomaly data and with an algorithm based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) methods. Two regions of high variability are identified. The first region, between 3\textdegree{} and 12\textdegree N, is characterized by the presence of westward-propagating eddies linked to the North Brazil Current (NBC) retroflection in the vicinity of the Brazilian coast. They show a strong annual cycle. In this paper the EMD algorithm points out that this signal is frequency modulated shifting from large length-scale structures in October to smaller ones in March. Consequently, the number of "eddies" per year can be aliased, according to the time and location of sampling, and can impact the percentage they explain of the interhemispheric exchange of mass and heat associated with the meridional overturning circulation's upper limb. A scenario concerning this dynamics is proposed. The second region reveals the presence of westward-propagating instability waves centered north of the equator (3\textdegree -7\textdegree N) between 50\textdegree{} and 10\textdegree W. These instability waves are also frequency modulated and show a strong seasonal cycle with maximum amplitude around August.}

The cooler Atlantic layer is primarily attributable to an enhanced cooling of these waters in a narrow band over the continental slope and shelf of the southern Beaufort Sea prior to their inflow into the Archipelago.

  year = {2004},
  number = {June},
  abstract = {The large-scale wind-driven ocean circulation is found to be sensitive to the choice of both the lateral boundary condition and the method of implementation. Where model boundaries consist ofirregular piecewise-constant steps, a classical free-slip like circulation is only maintained when the free-slip condition is implemented using the Vorticity-Divergence form of the viscous stress tensor. The Ghost-Point method is only capable of such a solution when the boundary located relative vorticity is explicitly set to zero. Free-slip solutions in particular, regardless ofthe method of implementation, are highly sensitive to the orientation of the piecewise-constant steps and we suggest two mechanisms, one physical and one numerical, by which this sensitivity can be understood. In the second part of this thesis, the spurious stress irregular piecewise-constant coastlines exert on the model flow is quantified by numerically modelling impulsive boundary layer development. In the absence of planetary rotation, the Vorticity-Divergence method of implementation is found to be superior to the Ghost-Point method for flows along irregular coastlines, but is shown to be a dangerous choice as the method ofimplementation when planetary rotation is included. Including planetary rotation induces the formation of jets near the domain boundaries which alter both the across-channel flow profile and the time dependence ofthe boundary shear stress from 1/t1/2, for non-rotating cases, to 1/t1/4, for rotating cases. We have developed a simple theoretical model of boundary layer development under the influence of rotation that explains these results. Finally,Finally, the phenomenon of western boundary current separation is studied and found to be a consistent feature of both the Ghost-Point and Vorticity-Divergence implemented no-slip model solutions. Separation is completely suppressed under Vorticity-Divergence implemented free-slip conditions. Separation is observed under Ghost-Point implemented free-slip conditions, but can be suppressed by explicitly setting the boundary located relative vorticity to zero. i},

Surface/mixed layer properties are found to be sensitive to the use of the relative wind stress formulation, where the wind stress depends on the difference between the ocean and atmosphere velocities. Previous work has highlighted the surface eddy damping effect of this formulation, which we find leads to increased circumpolar transport. Nevertheless the transport due to thermal wind shear does lose sensitivity to wind stress changes at sufficiently high wind stress. In contrast, the sensitivity of the meridional overturning circulation is broadly the same regardless of the bulk formula used due to the adiabatic nature of the relative wind stress damping. This is a consequence of the steepening of isopycnals offsetting the reduction in eddy diffusivity in their contribution to the eddy bolus overturning, as predicted using a residual mean framework.},

The solution for zonal winds (section 3) gives the main gyres of the ocean circulation. The northern and southern boundaries of these gyres are the west wind drift, the equatorial currents, and equatorial counter-current. They are determined by the westerly winds, the trades, and the doldrums, respectively. For each gyre the solution gives the following observed features (from west to east): a concentrated current (e.g., the Gulf Stream), a countercurrent, boundary vortices (the Sargasso Sea), and a steady compensating drift.

The primitive equation models used for these simulations have a free surface and realistic coastline geometry including a detailed representation of the Lesser Antilles island arc. Two simulations have 1/4\textdegree{} resolution and include a 5.5-layer reduced gravity and a 6-layer model with realistic bottom topography. Both are wind forced and include the global thermohaline circulation. The third simulation is from a 1/2\textdegree{} linear wind-driven model. In the two nonlinear numerical simulations, potential vorticity from decaying rings shed by the North Brazil Current retroflection can be advected through the Lesser Antilles. This potential vorticity acts as a finite amplitude perturbation for mixed barotropic and internal mode baroclinic instabilities, which amplify mesoscale features in the Caribbean. The eddies associated with the Caribbean Current are primarily anticyclonic and transit a narrow corridor across the Caribbean basin along an axis at 14\textdegree{} to 15\textdegree N with an average speed of 0.15 m/s. It takes them an average of 10 months to transit from the Lesser Antilles to the Yucatan Channel. Along the way, many of the eddies intensify greatly. The amount of intensification depends substantially on the strength of the Caribbean Current and is greatest during a multiyear period when the current is anomalously strong owing to interannual variation in the wind forcing. Some Caribbean eddies squeeze through the Yucatan Channel into the Gulf of Mexico, where they can influence the timing of Loop Current eddy-shedding events. There is a significant correlation of 0.45 between the Loop Current eddy shedding and the eddies near the Lesser Antilles with a time lag of 11 months. However, Caribbean eddies show no statistically significant net influence on the mean eddy-shedding period nor on the size and strength of shed eddies in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, no significant correlation is found between eddy shedding in the Gulf of Mexico and transport variations in the Florida Straits, although transport fluctuations in the Florida Straits at 27\textdegree N and the Yucatan Channel and showed a correlation of about 0.7 with a lag of 15 days. The linear solution exhibited a multiyear anomaly in the strength of the Caribbean circulation that was concentrated in the central and eastern Caribbean due to a multiyear anomaly in the wind field over the basin. In the nonlinear simulation this anomaly extended into the western Caribbean and across the entire Gulf of Mexico. This westward extension resulted from the nonlinearity and instability of the Caribbean Current, the westward propagation of the eddies, and the passage of Caribbean eddies through the Yucatan Channel into the Gulf of Mexico.

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddies contain the bulk of the ocean's kinetic energy (KE), but fundamental questions remain on the cross-scale KE transfers linking eddy generation and dissipation. The role of submesoscale flows represents the key point of discussion, with contrasting views of submesoscales as either a source or a sink of mesoscale KE. Here, the first observational assessment of the annual cycle of the KE transfer between mesoscale and submesoscale motions is per-formed in the upper layers of a typical open-ocean region. Although these diagnostics have marginal statistical significance and should be regarded cautiously, they are physically plausible and can provide a valuable benchmark for model evalua-tion. The cross-scale KE transfer exhibits two distinct stages, whereby submesoscales energize mesoscales in winter and drain mesoscales in spring. Despite this seasonal reversal, an inverse KE cascade operates throughout the year across much of the mesoscale range. Our results are not incompatible with recent modeling investigations that place the head-waters of the inverse KE cascade at the submesoscale, and that rationalize the seasonality of mesoscale KE as an inverse cascade-mediated response to the generation of submesoscales in winter. However, our findings may challenge those investigations by suggesting that, in spring, a downscale KE transfer could dampen the inverse KE cascade. An exploratory appraisal of the dynamics governing mesoscale\textendash submesoscale KE exchanges suggests that the upscale KE transfer in winter is underpinned by mixed layer baroclinic instabilities, and that the downscale KE transfer in spring is associated with frontogenesis. Current submesoscale-permitting ocean models may substantially understate this downscale KE transfer, due to the models' muted representation of frontogenesis.},

The theory approximates layer thickness on the eastern boundary with domain-averaged layer thickness and, in tandem with a mass conservation argument, retains fundamental physics for cross-equatorial flows on interannual and longer forcing timescales. Layer thickness anomalies are driven by a time-dependent northern boundary condition that imposes a southward volume flux representative of a variable source of NADW and damped by diapycnal mixing throughout the basin. Moreover, an outflowing southern boundary condition imposes a southward volume flux that generally differs from the volume flux at the northern boundary, giving rise to temporal storage of NADW within the Atlantic basin. Closed form analytic solutions for the amplitude and phase are provided when the variable source of NADWis sinusoidal. We provide a nondimensional analysis ...},

  abstract = {Existing nonlinear theories for the effect of the equator on northward-flowing boundary jets adjacent to a finite depth upper layer suggest that such inertial currents can flow from the southern to the northern hemisphere with the equator playing no special role (Anderson and Moore, 1979, Deep-Sea Research, 26, 1-22). It is demonstrated in this paper that, in contrast to these flows, nonlinear currents bounded by a front on their open ocean side (i.e. no adjacent upper layer) experience traumatic changes in their structure as they approach the equator. Within a deformation radius away from the equator, they separate from the coast and turn eastward to form a swift narrow jet. The equator blocks their advancement into the northern hemisphere. The above behavior is demonstrated by examining two nonlinear analytical models. First, we consider a simple highly idealized 1 1 2 layer model of a (southern hemisphere) wedge-like boundary current flowing northward with a wall on its left and a front on its right (looking downstream). It is almost a trivial matter to demonstrate analytically that such a current (which is just a special case of the Anderson and Moore flow) cannot penetrate into the northern hemisphere. Instead, it must separate from the coast in the vicinity of the equator. Secondly, a more realistic and more complicated 2 1 2 layer model is considered. In this nonlinear analytical model the current consists of two active layers. As in the previous model, the core of the current is a wedge-like layer (i.e. it is bounded by a front on the oceanic side) but the remaining surrounding field (i.e. the second moving layer) extends to infinity. It is shown that the flow in the second layer car cross the equator without any traumatic changes (as suggested by Anderson and Moore, 1979), but the core must again separate from the coast in the vicinity of the equator. As in the previous model, the current associated with the core is blocked by the equator. The general picture of the 2 1 2 layers is then of an initial two-layer inertial boundary current flowing toward the equator in the southern hemisphere. In the immediate vicinity of the equator the current splits into two branches. One separates from the coast and turns eastward whereas the other continues flowing northward until it ultimately reaches its own mid-latitude separation point. Possible application of this theory to the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent is briefly discussed. This current turns offshore at the equator as predicted by our model. \textcopyright{} 1990.},

  abstract = {Previous investigations of upper ocean currents on a {$\beta$}-plane have shown that it is quite difficult for a parcel of fluid to cross the equator in the open ocean. Boundary currents sometimes can cross the equator, but even this crossing is not easily achieved. The main barrier for equatorial crossing of inviscid western boundary currents is the presence of a front on the open ocean side (Nof, 1990, Deep-Sea Research, 37, 853-875). One-and-a-half and 2 1 2 layer models are used to examine how this frontal blocking constraint is modified by bottom topography. Both models show that some topographic features, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, may entirely relax the frontal blocking constraint. The single layer crossing is modeled in terms of a heavy double-fronted inertial current (overlaid by a stagnant infinitely deep upper layer) flowing northward in a parabolic channel. Analytic solutions show that the current's position "flips" as it crosses the equator, it is situated next to the left flank of the channel (i.e. the western boundary) in the southern hemisphere and next to the right flank (i.e. the eastern part of the channel corresponding to the western side of the the mid-ocean ridge) in the northern hemisphere. With the aid of the above model, a 2 1 2 layer model, which contains an additional intermediate current above the core, is considered. It is found that the nonfrontal southward (or northward) intermediate flow crosses the equator and remains adjacent to the western boundary. In contrast, the deep frontal flow underneath again "flips" from the left to the right boundary as it crosses the equator. Possible application of this theory to the dense Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and the Lower North Atlantic Deep Water (LNADW) is discussed. \textcopyright{} 1993.},

  abstract = {The classical question of what happens when a warm western boundary current, such as the North Brazil Current (NBC), retroflects is addressed analytically using a reduced-gravity nonlinear model. The traditional view is that the northwestward flowing current separates from the wall, turns to the right (looking offshore), and forms a zonal boundary current that flows eastward. Integration of the steady inviscid momentum equation along the boundary gives the longshore momentum flux (or flow force) and shows that such a scenario leads to a paradox. To resolve the paradox the separated current must constantly shed anticyclones, which propagate to the northwest due to {$\beta$} and an interaction with the boundary. This new eddy shedding mechanism, which is not related to the traditional instability of a zonal jet, may explain why the NBC must produce rings. A nonlinear analytical solution to the problem is constructed with the aid of a powerful theoretical approach based on the idea that nonlinear periodic flows can be integrated over a control volume. This method enables us to extract all the details of the resulting features without solving for the details of the incredibly complicated three-dimensional and time-dependent generation process. Due to the strong nonlinearity of the problem, the method is quite different from the familiar averaging technique that requires the existence of a "mean" current. To employ the above method, however, it was necessary to derive a new nonlinear formula for the {$\beta$}-induced migration of eddies adjacent to a zonal boundary that slopes in the N-S direction. It turns out that the general problem involves an eddy retroflection length scale Rd/{$\epsilon$}1/6 (where Rd is the parent current Rossby radius and {$\epsilon$} = {$\beta$}Rd/f0) that is greater than that of most eddies (Rd). Calculations show that, for the retroflected NBC, which transports about 45 Sv, eddies are shed approximately once every 90 days.},

  abstract = {The western equatorial Atlantic is characterized by the formation and shedding of 3-4 large anticyclonic rings per year. These rings originate from the North Brazil Current which, in response to the vanishing wind stress curl (over the ocean interior), retroflects and turns eastward at around 4\textdegree N. After their formation and shedding the rings propagate toward the northwest along the South American coast carrying an annual average of about 4Sv. As such, the rings constitute an important part of the meridional heat flu in the Atlantic. The same cannot be said, however, of the western equatorial Pacific. Here, the situation is entirely different even thought he South Equatorial Current retroflects at roughly the same latitude as its Atlantic counterpart, the North Brazil Current. Although the South Equatorial Current retroflection is flanked by two quasi-permanent eddies (the so-called Halmahera and the Mindanao eddies), these eddies are an integral part of the current itself and are not shed. Consequently, they ar not associated with any meridional heart flux. An important question is, then, why the two oceans behave in such a fundamentally different way even though the source of the rings, the retroflected currents, are very similar in the two oceans. To answer this question, the two oceans are compared using recently developed analytical and numerical models for the western equatorial oceans. It is first pointed out that, according to recent developments in the modelling of the western equatorial Atlantic, the North Brazil Current retroflection rings are formed, shed and drift to the west because, in the Atlantic, this is the only way by which the momentum flux of the approaching and retroflecting current can be balanced. In this scenario, the northwestward flow force exerted by the approaching and retroflecting North Brazil Current (analogous to the force created by a rocket) is balanced by the southwestward force exerted by the rings as they are formed (analogous in some sense to the kickback associated with a firing gun). On the other hand, in the western equatorial Pacific, the formation and shedding of rings is unnecessary because the southward flowing Mindanao Current provides an alternative mechanism for balancing the northward momentum flux of the South Equatorial Current. This implies that it is the absence of a counter current (such as the Mindanao) in the western Atlantic that causes the formation and shedding of North Brazil Current rings. A remaining difficulty with the above scenario is that most colliding and retroflecting currents (i.e. the Mindanao and South Equatorial currents) are not 'balanced' in the case of the western Pacific, the long-shore migration is arrested by the Indonesian. Throughflow which allows the 'unbalanced' fraction of the approaching currents to leak out into the Indian Ocean. This resolves the above difficulty and allows the retroflection to be approximately steady.},

We first examined analytically the nonlinear, steady, frictionless case and, as a second step, we considered a nonlinear numerical simulation (of the Bleck and Boudra type). We then compared the results of these two (fluid) models to each other and to the solid-balls model of Borisov and Nof which examined the migration of particles in the same cross-equatorial channel.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nAll three models show that, in general, the current (or a 'cloud' of solid particles) advances gradually toward the equator without much change to its structure. Upon reaching the vicinity of the equator, the current width (or the distance between neighbouring balls) decreases dramatically. The current (or cloud) then turns eastward, flows rapidly downslope, and rises on the eastern side. The now (or cloud) ultimately splits into two parts, one progressing northward and the other recirculating and advancing southward.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRemarkably good agreement is found between the detailed solid-particles analysis and the new numerical fluid simulations, indicating that the inter-hemispheric exchange is primarily an inertial process that depends mainly on the channel geometry. It is shown that the partition of mass flux between the two hemispheres depends on the way that the solid particles, or the current-jet, impinge on the eastern flank of the channel. In contrast to the very good agreement between the solid balls and the fluid simulations, poor agreement was found between the detailed analytical prediction for the cross-equatorial transport and the numerical solution (even when the viscosity was as small as we could use for numerical stability). However, the analytical solution does give the correct prediction for the position of the resulting currents and their general behaviour. It is argued that the disagreement between the analytically calculated fluid mass transports (which, in contrast to the balls, is subject to a potential-vorticity constraint) and the numerical computations is due to the alteration of potential vorticity. Specifically, the friction alters the potential vorticity of the flow and prevents it from acting as a constraint to the crossing. Though crucial to the crossing, the role of friction is, therefore, passive. It merely allows the fluid to alter its potential vorticity in such a manner that the flow can adapt to the crossing pattern imposed by the geometry.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nIt is suggested that the observed recirculation of Antarctic Bottom Water in the vicinity of the equatorial Atlantic may be a result of our splitting process.},

  abstract = {The formation rate of water masses and its relation to air-sea fluxes and interior mixing are examined in an isopycnic model of the North (and tropical) Atlantic that includes a mixed layer. The diagnostics follow Walin's formulation, linking volume and potential density budgets for an isopycnal layer. The authors consider the balance between water mass production, mixing, and air-sea fluxes in the model in the context of two limit cases: (i) with no mixing, where air-sea fluxes drive water mass formation directly, and (ii) a steady state in a closed basin, where air-sea fluxes are balanced by diffusion. In such a steady state, since mixing always acts to reduce density contrast, surface forcing must act to increase it. Considered over the whole basin, including the Tropics, the model is in steady state apart from the densest layers. Most of the mixing is achieved by diapycnal diffusion in the strong density gradients within upwelling regions in the Tropics, and by entrainment into the tropical mixed layer. Mixing from entrainment associated with the seasonal cycle of mixed layer depth in mid and high latitudes and lateral mixing of density within the mixed layer are less important than this tropical mixing. These model results as to the relative importance of the different mixing processes are consistent with a simple scaling analysis. Outside the Tropics, the upwelling-linked mixing is no longer important, and a first-order estimate of water mass formation rates may be made from the surface fluxes. Lateral mixing of density within the mixed layer and seasonal entrainment mixing are as important as the remaining thermocline mixing within this domain. An apparent vertical diffusivity is diagnosed over both the full and extratropical domain. It reaches 10-4 m2 s-1 for the denser waters, about four times as large as the explicit diapycnal diffusion within the thermocline.},

The customary approach to stability problems by means of the eigen-solution with a separate, time-dependent factor is not generally applicable because eigen-solutions do not necessarily exist in this problem. Instead, the perturbation equation for meridional motion is considered as an initial value problem, and the stability of a given circular vortex is determined from consideration of the total kinetic energy of meridional motion. That is, the vortex is considered stable if the total kinetic energy of the perturbation is always bounded for any initial disturbance; and the vortex is considered unstable if there exists at least one set of initial data for which the total kinetic energy of the perturbation would increase with time beyond limit.

It is proven that the proposed condition was shown to be free of reflection for single wave propagation. Two severe tests were used to demonstrate the applicability of the open boundary condition: (i) the collapsing bubble, a dynamic event which excites many different internal gravity waves. The results show minimum distortion. (ii) The spatially growing K-H instability. This test differs from the previous one in that the only waves excited are those corresponding to the maximum unstable wavelengths. In this case, the maximum amplitude is reached at the open boundary. As it has been shown, the open boundary condition (2.2) produces minimum distortion. \textcopyright{} 1976.},

About 16 to 20 anticyclonic eddies were identified during the period from October 1992 to June 1997. These eddies propagate northwestward along the continental shelf. As these eddies approach the Lesser Antilles island chain, their amplitudes decrease. Most of these eddies were able to penetrate the narrow passages of the Windward Islands. Once they enter the Caribbean Sea, their amplitudes increase, probably due to the strong meridional shear of the Caribbean Current. It takes more than a year for these eddies to travel from the North Brazil coast, through the Caribbean Sea and eventually to the Yucatan Peninsula. The observed eddy sizes range from 200 to 600 km, their average amplitude is about 15 cm, their average propagation speed is around 14 cm/s, and their time scale is about 80 to 100 days. In contrast to the tropical instability waves which are only present in the autumn season, no seasonal dependence is observed in the generation of these anticyclonic eddies.}

Recently, the southwest Irminger Sea has been suggested as an additional location for open-ocean deep convection. The deep water formed in the Irminger Sea has the characteristic temperature and salinity of the water mass that fills the mid-depth North Atlantic Ocean, which had been believed to be formed entirely in the Labrador basin. Here we show that the most likely cause of the convection in the Irminger Sea is a low-level atmospheric jet known as the Greenland tip jet, which forms periodically in the lee of Cape Farewell, Greenland, and is associated with elevated heat flux and strong wind stress curl. Using a history of tip-jet events derived from meteorological land station data and a regional oceanic numerical model, we demonstrate that deep convection can occur in this region when the North Atlantic Oscillation Index is high, which is consistent with observations. This mechanism of convection in the Irminger Sea differs significantly from those known to operate in the Labrador and Mediterranean seas.},

By decomposing w with an omega equation of the primitive-equation system and by taking into account the measurement design of the SWOT mission, this study seeks to reconstruct the subinertial, balanced w and {$\zeta$} signals. By adopting the effective surface quasi-geostrophic (eSQG) framework and applying to the Kuroshio Extension region of the North Pacific, we find that the target and reconstructed fields have a spatial correlation of \textasciitilde{} 0.7 below the mixed layer for w and 0.7 {$\sim$} 0.9 throughout the 1000 m upper ocean for {$\zeta$} in the error-free scenario. By taking the SWOT sampling and measurement errors into account, the spatial correlation is found to decrease to 0.4 \textasciitilde{} 0.6 below the mixed layer for w and 0.6 \textasciitilde{} 0.7 for {$\zeta$}, respectively. For both w and {$\zeta$}reconstruction, the degradation due to the SWOT errors is more significant in the surface layer and for smaller-scale signals.

In a neutral or stably stratified atmosphere one circulation is expressed in terms of an analytic solution that contains Hermite polynomials, while a second solution is described in terms of a Bessel function. In the more traditional Hermite polynomial solution the influence of f7 is small as suggested by scale analysis. Neutral stability provides the only exception. In contrast to these findings, the Bessel solution contains frequencies with semiannual periods that depend entirely on f7"0. This solution describes cross-equatorial flow with a maximum meridional velocity at the equator. Consequently, this indicates that to model the atmosphere it is necessary to include in the model equations all terms containing f7, since they influence oscillatory circulations that describe internal waves with periods that vary from a few days to semiannual.

The CTD data were used to calculate the contribution of South Atlantic water (SAW) in the upper 1200 m between the isopycnals {$\sigma\theta$}=24.5 and 27.6. Northern and southern source water masses are defined and an isopycnal mixing approach is applied. The SAW fractions are then combined with the ADCP flow field to calculate the transport of SAW into the Caribbean and across 16\textdegree N. The SAW inflow into the Caribbean through the passages south of Guadeloupe ranges from 7.6 to 11.6 Sv, which is 50-75\% of the total inflow. The mean (9.1{$\pm$}2.2 Sv) is in the range of previous estimates. Ambiguities in the northern and southern source water masses of the salinity maximum water permitted us only to calculate the contribution of SAW from the eastern source in this water mass. We estimated the additional SAW transport by the western source to be of the order of 1.9{$\pm$}0.7 Sv. The calculation of the SAW transport across 16\textdegree N was hampered by the presence of several anticyclonic rings from the North Brazil Current (NBC) retroflection region, some of the rings were subsurface intensified. Provided that the rings observed at 16\textdegree N are typical rings and that all rings which are annually produced in the NBC retroflection area (6.5-8.5 per year) reach 16\textdegree N, the SAW ring transport across 16\textdegree N is calculated to 5.3{$\pm$}0.7 Sv. From the 5 repeats at 16\textdegree N, only two showed a net northward flow, suggesting that the mean northward SAW transport is dominated by ring advection. The joint SAW transports of the Caribbean inflow (9.1 Sv) and the flow across 16\textdegree N (5.3 Sv) sum up to 14.4 Sv. The transport increases to 16.3 Sv if the additional SAW transport from the western source of SMW (1.9{$\pm$}0.7 Sv) is included. These transport estimates and the following implications depend strongly on the assumption that the surface water in the Caribbean inflow is of South Atlantic origin. The transport estimates are, however, in the range of the inverse model calculations for the net cross-hemispheric flow. About 30-40\% of this transport is intermediate water from the South Atlantic, presumably supporting studies which found the contributions of intermediate and upper warm water to be of a comparable magnitude. For the upper warm water ({$\sigma\theta <$}27.1), the Caribbean inflow seems to be the major path (7.9{$\pm$}1.6 Sv), the ring induced transport across 16\textdegree N is about 30\% of that value. The intermediate water transport across 16\textdegree N was calculated to be 2.3-3.6 Sv, the inflow into the Caribbean is slightly smaller (1.5-2.4 Sv). \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {A detailed linear stability analysis of an easterly barotropic Gaussian jet centered at the equator is performed in the long-wave sector in the framework of one- and two-layer shallow-water models on the equatorial {$\beta$}-plane. It is shown that the dominant instability of the jet is due to phase-locking and resonance between Yanai waves, although the standard barotropic and baroclinic instabilities due to the resonance between Rossby waves are also present. In the one-layer case, this dominant instability has non-zero growth rate at zero wavenumber for high enough Rossby and low enough Burger numbers, thus reproducing the classical symmetric inertial instability. Yet its asymmetric counterpart has the highest growth rate. In the two-layer case, the dominant instability may be barotropic or baroclinic, the latter being stronger, with the maximum of the growth rate shifting towards smaller downstream wavenumbers as Rossby number increases at fixed Burger number, and given thickness and density ratios. At large enough Rossby numbers this instability has a non-zero growth rate limit at zero wavenumber, giving the baroclinic symmetric inertial instability. Again, the maximal growth rate is achieved at small but non-zero wavenumbers, corresponding to the asymmetric inertial instability. At high enough Rossby number and low enough Burger number not only the baroclinic, but also the barotropic symmetric instability appears, as well as higher meridional modes of the baroclinic symmetric instability. Still, all of them are dominated by their asymmetric counterparts. Direct numerical simulations of the saturation of the leading instabilities are performed, showing that the barotropic species of the instability saturates by forming a double vortex street subject to nonlinear oscillations, while the baroclinic, the most vigorous one, saturates by producing strong vertical shears and related dissipation and mixing.},

  abstract = {During 1989-1992, six different anticyclonic eddies were observed to translate up the coast of South America between 7\textdegree N and 12\textdegree N. These eddies, which are similar to those recently observed with coastal zone color scanner images, current meters, and altimetry, are inferred to have formed from pieces of the North Brazil Current, which retroflects or veers offshore near 7\textdegree N to flow eastward. The maximum near-surface diameter of the eddies when newly formed is estimated to be 400 km. The retroflection eddies were identified in trajectories of four surface drifters and three SOFAR floats at depths from 900-1200 m that looped as they translated northwestward with a mean velocity of 9 cm/s. The characteristics of the eddies are discussed. -from Authors}

  abstract = {Fourteen neutrally buoyant SOFAR floats at a nominal depth of 1800 m were tracked acoustically for 3.7 yr in the vicinity of the western boundary and the equator of the Atlantic Ocean. The trajectories revealed a swift, narrow, southward-flowing deep western boundary current (DWBC) extending from 7N across the equator. Two floats crossed the equator in the DWBC and went to 10S. Two other floats left the DWBC and drifted eastward in the equatorial band (3S-3N). Three floats entered the DWBC from the equatorial current system and drifted southward. These results suggest that at times the DWBC flows directly southward across the equator with a mean velocity of 8-9 cm/s averaged over long distances (\textasciitilde 2800 km). At other times DWBC water is diverted eastward near the equator for long periods (2-3 yr), which can reduce the mean along-boundary velocity to 1-2 cm/s. This is much less than the instantaneous along-boundary velocities in the DWBC, which are often above 25 cm/s and occasionally exceed 50 cm/s. Mean eastward-flowing jets were observed near 2N and 2S bounding a mean westward jet centered on the equator (1S-1N). The southern jet at 2S coincides with a CFC-rich plume centered south of the equator. The CFC plume is inferred to have been advected by the southern jet across the Atlantic and into the Gulf of Guinea.},

During 1983-1985 the Lagrangian circulation was studied by launching and tracking 30 freely drifting drogued buoys in the North Equatorial Countercurrent and 23 in the South Equatorial Current (SEC). In addition, continuously recording current meters were moored for 20 months at depths from 20 to 300 m near the center of the NECC, at 6\textdegree N, 28\textdegree W. These measurements are the longest series ever obtained in this current and provide information about its seasonal and interannual variations and zonal, meridional, and vertical structure. The seasonal cycle of the NECC is very regular from year to year. Each year the NECC starts up in May-June. It flows eastward across the Atlantic with surface speeds of up to 143 cm/s in the west, extending down to 350 m at 28\textdegree W, and flowing into both the Guinea Current and North Equatorial Current. It disappears or reverses from about January-June west of 18\textdegree W. Some near-surface water of the NECC is inferred to downwell and flow equatorward toward the Equatorial Undercurrent. The SEC flows into the North Brazil Current, which during spring continues up the coast into the Caribbean. During fall, however, the whole North Brazil Current retroflects, or turns back on itself, between 45 \textdegree{} and 50\textdegree W, forming the western NECC. The retroflection establishes a meander pattern in the NECC that slowly propagates westward during fall at a speed of 4 cm/s. The meanders have a displacement of about 300 km in latitude, a wavelength of 900 km, and meridional velocity fluctuations of up to 100 cm/s. The swift currents and time-dependent meanders in the western NECC cause a high eddy kinetic energy, {$\sim$} 2400 cm2/s2, equivalento that of the energeticp art of the Gulf Stream.}

Only five integrals of motion are, to lowest order, quadratic in the vorticity from the equilibrium state: energy, enstrophy (square of potential vorticity deviation), (horizontal) linear pseudo-momenta and (vertical) angular pseudo-momentum. These conservation laws are found to be related to the symmetries of the system, namely, invariance under time translations, change of the particles label in each isopycnal, horizontal translations and rotations around a vertical axis, respectively. The nonlinear equations are studied for three different descriptions of the system: Eulerian, Lagragian and mixed (Eulerian in the horizontal and Lagragian in the vertical). In particular, it is discussed whether the eigenvectors of the linear evolution operator form an orthogonal and complete basis or not. If they do, then a phase-space expansion of the dynamical variables and the corresponding evolution equations for the amplitudes are easily and exactly obtained. Neither a hypothesis on the magnitude of these amplitudes nor a reduction of the model equations are needed in this latter case.},

Annual mean meridional velocity averaged within a 2\textdegree{} longitude band off the South American coast shows that the SEC bifurcation occurs at about 10\textdegree -14\textdegree S near the surface, shifting poleward with increasing depth, reaching 27\textdegree S at 1000 m, in both observations and model. The bifurcation latitude reaches its southernmost position in July ({$\sim$}17\textdegree S in the top 200 m) and its northernmost position in November ({$\sim$}13\textdegree S in the top 200 m). The model results show that most of the seasonal variability of the bifurcation latitude in the upper thermocline is associated with changes in the local wind stress curl due to the annual north-south excursion of the marine ITCZ complex. As the SEC bifurcation latitude moves south (north) the NBUC transport increases (decreases) and the BC transport decreases (increases). The remote forcing (i.e., westward propagation of anomalies) appears to have a smaller impact on the seasonal variability of the bifurcation in the upper thermocline. \textcopyright{} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

  abstract = {The model developed and tested in Part I of this paper is used to investigate the mechanisms that sustain the low-level East African jet. The East African Highlands and a land/sea contrast in surface friction are shown to be essential for the existence and concentration of cross-equatorial flow. The question of inertial instability as air crosses the equator is addressed from a potential vorticity (PV) perspective. Surface friction and local diabatic heating provide mechanisms for material modification of PV and both are important for the maintenance of the jet. A compensation phenomenon that stabilizes the flow is suggested whereby reduced material tendencies of PV over the Indian Ocean are compensated for by increased modification over Africa. It is speculated that this stabilization may be a key ingredient in the monsoon circulation itself. However, in some cases there is intensification and increased variability of the wind speed maximum off the Somali coast, which may be an indication of reduced PV modification due to weaker material tendencies of PV. The tendency of the southern flank of the low-level monsoon inflow to turn anticyclonically over the Arabian Sea and to avoid India may also be a sign of weaker PV modification. The study identifies strong sensitivity of the East African jet to changes in heating over the southern Indian Ocean and highlights the importance of reliable data in this region for monsoon prediction.},

In addition to the NBC rings being the most prominent dynamic feature after the retroflection, the shelf flow plays an important role in the regional circulation. We present a recent implementation of an operational modeling system for this region using the feature oriented regional modeling system (FORMS) methodology for the NBC rings and shelf flow. A new formulation of the ring is presented in which the synoptic structures of temperature and salinity profiles are placed at the core and the climatological profiles are placed around the edge. The shelf-break front is feature modeled by interpolating between a representative temperature profile on the shelf and the monthly climatology 200 km offshore of the coastline. The feature oriented scheme is used to initialize an operational forecasting system using the Harvard Ocean Prediction System (HOPS) framework. Three case studies between 2011 and 2012 are presented, wherein real drifter's trajectories within several NBC rings and the shelf are compared with those of the model drifters. These examples highlight the advantages of using feature models for short-term operational forecasting, in that, changing ring size and center location, changing level of no motion (LNM) and using drifter data for shelf flow verification allow for better predictability for the 4-5 days forecasts. These capabilities could be extended operationally to provide 2-3 week outlooks to offshore industry in the future. \textcopyright{} 2012 IEEE.},

Large- and small-scale surveys, microstructure studies and temporal monitoring of the layers were carried out in spring and autumn of 1985 in an area east of Barbados in the tropical Atlantic. The staircase investigated contained about 10 well-mixed layers, 5-30 m thick, separated by thinner interfaces with sharp changes in temperature and salinity. The depth range of the layers coincided with a minimum density ratio. The area of strong steps was 0.5\texttimes{} 106 km2 in the spring and 0.6 \texttimes{} 106 km2 in the autumn. Individual layers were laterally coherent over scales of 200-400 km and retained their identity for the eight months between surveys. Layers became warmer, saltier and denser to the north and west, with a heat/salt density ratio of 0.85. This ratio is close to that expected for a vertically divergent salt finger flux. This direct indication of water mass conversion provides striking evidence that salt fingers maintain the staircase and make a major contribution to mixing in the thermocline of the region. \textcopyright{} 1987.},

At 5\textdegree S, the mean from nine sections yields an NBUC transport of 26.5 {$\pm$} 3.7 Sv (Sv {$\equiv$} 106 m3 s-1) along the boundary; at 11\textdegree S the mean NBUC transport from five sections is 25.4 {$\pm$} 7.4 Sv, confirming that the NBUC is already well developed at 11\textdegree S. At both latitudes a persistent offshore southward recirculation between 200- and 1100-m depth reduces the net northward warm water flow through the 5\textdegree S section (west of 31.5\textdegree W) to 22.1 {$\pm$} 5.3 Sv and through the 11\textdegree S section to 21.7 {$\pm$} 4.1 Sv (west of 32.0\textdegree W).

The bulk of the northward warm water flow follows the coast in the North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC) from latitudes south of 10\textdegree S, carrying 23 Sv (Sv {$\equiv$} 106 m3 s-1) above 1000 m. Out of this, 16 Sv are waters warmer than 7\textdegree C that form the source waters of the Florida Current. Zonal inflow from the east by the South Equatorial Current enters the western boundary system dominantly north of 5\textdegree S, adding transport northwest of Cape San Roque, and transforming the NBUC along its way toward the equator into a surface-intensified current, the North Brazil Current (NBC). From the combination of moored arrays and shipboard sections just north of the equator along 44\textdegree W, the mean NBC transport was determined at 35 Sv with a small seasonal cycle amplitude of only about 3 Sv. The reason for the much larger near-equatorial northward warm water boundary current than what would be required to carry the northward heat transport are recirculations by the zonal current system and the existence of the shallow South Atlantic tropical-subtropical cell (STC). The STC connects the subduction zones of the eastern subtropics of both hemispheres via equatorward boundary undercurrents with the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC), and the return flow is through upwelling and poleward Ekman transport. The persistent existence of a set of eastward thermocline and intermediate countercurrents on both sides of the equator was confirmed that recurred throughout the observations and carry ventilated waters from the boundary regime into the tropical interior. A strong westward current underneath the EUC, the Equatorial Intermediate Current, returns low-oxygen water westward. Consistent evidence for the existence of a seasonal variation in the warm water flow south of the equator could not be established, whereas significant seasonal variability of the boundary regime occurs north of the equator: northwestward alongshore throughflow of about 10 Sv of waters with properties from the Southern Hemisphere was found along the Guiana boundary in boreal spring when the North Equatorial Countercurrent is absent or even flowing westward, whereas during June-January the upper NBC is known to connect with the eastward North Equatorial Countercurrent through a retroflection zone that seasonally migrates up and down the coast and spawns eddies. The equatorial zone thus acts as a buffer and transformation zone for cross-equatorial exchanges, but knowledge of the detailed pathways in the interior including the involved diapycnal exchanges is still a problem.}

Horizon Marine, Inc. has conducted operational analysis of the NBC for the past 8 years, making use of drifting buoys, satellite imagery, and ADCP data. We have validated observations made by previous studies such as references [1-5] during this time period. Energy fluctuations within the NBC Retroflection can create a closed circulation at the point of inception of the North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC). This closed circulation can spin off as it gains momentum to create a separate anticyclonic eddy, known as an NBC ring. Our observations indicate that the NBC Retroflection sheds between 5 and 8 NBC rings over the period of 1 year. These rings vary from 100 to 500 km in diameter and 70 to 200 cms-1 in surface intensity. The depth of the coherent velocity structure can vary from 200m to 1000m as described in [1] and [4]. The structure and intensity of each ring varies seasonally as does its migration rate and trajectory. The energy sector offshore Trinidad and Tobago is most strongly impacted by the NBC ring influence on local oceanographic conditions, most critically the vigorous near-surface currents associated with the rings' strong vertically coherent velocity fields. The extent of this influence depends on the NBC ring proximity to the shelf break, the ring swirl velocity, and vertical variation in the ring velocity field. In this study, we quantify characteristic patterns of oceanographic variation imposed by NBC rings observed in our operational datasets. Of central importance is determining the variations in migration patterns of NBC rings with changing seasonality. \textcopyright 2009 MTS.},

The most unstable mode is shown by a linear analysis to occur in a narrow localized region centered around the maximum anticyclonic current shear. However, nonlinear numerical calculations show that the instability can grow to encompass both unstable and stable regions of the current. A consequence of this finite-amplitude evolution is the formation of surface convergence/shear fronts. The possibility that inertial instability mechanism is a source of some surface convergence/shear features seen in remote sensing images of the sea surface is discussed.

  abstract = {High resolution hydrographic observations of temperature and salinity are used to analyse the subsurface circulation along the eoast of North Brazil, off the Amazon mouth, between 20\textdegree{} S and 60\textdegree{} N. Observations are presented from four cruises carried out in different periods of the year (March-May 1995, May-June 1999, July-August 2001 and October-November 1997). Numerical model outputs complement the results of the shipboard measurements, and are used to complete the descriptions of mesoscale circulation. The Salinity Maximum Waters are here analyzed, principally in order to describe the penetration of waters originating in the Southern Hemisphere toward the Northern Hemisphere through the North Brazil Current (NBC)/North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC). Our results show that, if the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) is fed by Northern Atlantic Waters, this contribution may only occur in the ocean interior, east of the western boundary around 100 m depth. Modeling results indicate a southward penetration of the Western Boundary Undercurrent (WBUC) below the thermocline, along the North Brazilian coast into the EUC or the North Equatorial Undercurrent (NEUC) (around 480\textdegree{} W-30\textdegree{} N). The WBUC in the region does not flow more south than 3\textdegree{} N. The northern waters are diverted eastward either by the NBC retroflection or by the northern edge of the associated clockwise rings. The existence of subsurface mesoscale rings associated to the NBC retroflection is evidenced, without any signature in the surface layer, so confirming earlier numerical model outputs. These subsurface anticyclones, linked to the NBC/NBUC retroflection into the North Equatorial Undercurrent and the EUC, contribute to the transport of South Atlantic high salinity water into the Northern Hemisphere. \textcopyright{} Author(s) 2009.}

  abstract = {Abstract An extended period numerical integration of a baroclinic primitive equation model has been made for the simulation and the study of the dynamics of the atmosphere's general circulation. The solution corresponding to external gravitational propagation is filtered by requiring the vertically integrated divergence to vanish identically. The vertical structure permits as dependent variables the horizontal wind at two internal levels and a single temperature, with the static stability entering as a parameter. The incoming radiation is a function of latitude only corresponding to the annual mean, and the outgoing radiation is taken to be a function of the local temperature. With the requirement for thermal equilibrium, the domain mean temperature is specified as a parameter. The role of condensation is taken into account only as it effectively reduces the static stability. All other external sources and sinks of heat are assumed to balance each other locally, and are thus omitted. The kinematics are that of a fluid on a sphere bounded by smooth zonal walls at the equator and at approximately 64\textdegree{} latitude. The dissipative sinks are provided by: (a) surface stresses proportional through a drag coefficient to the square of the surface wind which is suitably extrapolated from above, (b) internal convective stresses proportional to the vertical wind shear, and (c) lateral diffusion of momentum and heat through an exchange coefficient which depends on the local horizontal rate of strain\textemdash a horizontal length scale entering as the governing parameter. For a given specification of the parameters, an integration for 60 days has been made from initial conditions where random temperature disturbances have been superimposed on a zonally symmetric regime which is baroclinically unstable according to linear theory. This experiment not only displays the scale selective character of baroclinic instability, yielding zonal wave number 5 to 6, but also predicts an index or energy cycle. The period of this cycle is 11 to 12 days for the first 40 days of the experiment, then lengthening to 17 days while diminishing in amplitude during the latter part. The resulting mean zonal velocity profile is in good qualitative agreement with observation, but too intense, presumably because the effective static stability parameter is taken too large. Furthermore this profile is found to be no more than 5 percent super-geostrophic poleward of the angular momentum maximum and no more than 2 percent sub-geostrophic equatorward. The total zonal angular momentum remains constant to within 2 percent irrespective of the phase of the index cycle. This balance is controlled by the surface wind distribution which agrees quite well with observation. The poleward transport is mainly accomplished by the large-scale eddies, whereas the internal vertical flux is predominantly a transfer of the earth's angular momentum by the meridional circulation. The poleward heat transport is primarily accomplished by a Hadley circulation at low latitudes but by the large-scale horizontal eddies in mid-latitudes, where a Ferrel circulation tends to compensate through an equatorward flux. This compensation at mid-latitudes by an indirect meridional circulation is also quite evident, in the potential-kinetic energy transformations. Comparison of the momentum and heat transfer with observed data when available shows reasonably good quantitative agreement. The lateral transfer of momentum and heat by the non-linear diffusion, which parametrically is supposed to simulate the action of motions of sub-grid scale, accounts for a significant portion of the total eddy transfer. Although no direct comparison with the corresponding transfer in the real atmosphere is available, intuitively our small-scale diffusion appears to play too large a role. A diagnosis is made of the transformations among the baratropic and baroclinic parts of the kinetic energy as well as the zonal mean and zonal perturbation parts of the available potential and kinetic energy. This reveals the dominant paths that the energy passes through from source to ultimate sinks and the processes responsible for these transformations. It is found that the partitioning of dissipation by the energy components may differ considerably from estimates made from observation.}

These layers influence mesoscale energy and potential vorticity budgets but cannot be fully represented in models without sloping boundaries, no-slip boundary conditions, and sufficiently high resolution. This paper investigates the detachment of these shear layers and their subsequent rolling up into concentrated eddies. These shed eddies, or "sheddies," may have significant oceanographic impacts. Their growth is considered using a simple point vortex model that adapts the Brown-Michael model of vortex shedding to quasigeostrophic flow and allows detailed consideration of the vorticity fluxes. The model shows good qualitative agreement with observations and experimental and numerical results. it is applied to a number of examples of well-known cases of sheddy formation, including the Agulhas cyclones, California Undercurrent, and Canary Eddy Corridor, and also is used to investigate the effects of shed vorticity in the growth of the Cook Strait eddy and the interaction of the North Brazil Current rings with the islands of the Lesser Antilles.},

  abstract = {Downfront, or downwelling favorable, winds are commonly found over buoyant coastal plumes. It is known that these winds can result in mixing of the plume with the ambient water and that the winds influence the transport, spatial extent, and stability of the plumes. In the present study, the interaction of the Ekman velocity in the surface layer and baroclinic instability supported by the strong horizontal density gradient of the plume is explored with the objective of understanding the potential vorticity and buoyancy budgets. The approach makes use of an idealized numerical model and scaling theory. It is shown that when winds are present the weak stratification resulting from vertical mixing and the strong baroclinicity of the front results in near-zero average potential vorticity q. For weak to moderate winds, the reduction of q by diapycnal mixing is balanced by the generation of q through the geostrophic stress term in the regions of strong horizontal density gradients and stable stratification. However, for very strong winds the wind stress overwhelms the geostrophic stress and leads to a reduction in q, which is balanced by the vertical mixing term. In the absence of winds, the geostrophic stress dominates mixing and the flow rapidly restratifies. Nonlinearity, extremes of relative vorticity and vertical velocity, and mixing are all enhanced by the presence of a coast. Scaling estimates developed for the eddy buoyancy flux, the surface potential vorticity flux, and the diapycnal mixing rate compare well with results diagnosed from a series of numerical model calculations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Water-mass transformation by turbulent mixing is a key part of the deep-ocean overturning, as it drives the upwelling of dense waters formed at high latitudes. Here, we quantify this transformation and its underpinning processes in a small Southern Ocean basin: the Orkney Deep. Observations reveal a focusing of the transport in density space as a deep western boundary current (DWBC) flows through the region, associated with lightening and densification of the current's denser and lighter layers, respectively. These transformations are driven by vigorous turbulent mixing. Comparing this transformation with measurements of the rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation indicates that, within the DWBC, turbulence operates with a high mixing efficiency, characterized by a dissipation ratio of 0.6 to 1 that exceeds the common value of 0.2. This result is corroborated by estimates of the dissipation ratio from microstructure observations. The causes of the transformation are unraveled through a decomposition into contributions dependent on the gradients in density space of the: dianeutral mixing rate, isoneutral area, and stratification. The transformation is found to be primarily driven by strong turbulence acting on an abrupt transition from the weakly stratified bottom boundary layer to well-stratified off-boundary waters. The reduced boundary layer stratification is generated by a downslope Ekman flow associated with the DWBC's flow along sloping topography, and is further regulated by submesoscale instabilities acting to restratify near-boundary waters. Our results provide observational evidence endorsing the importance of near-boundary mixing processes to deep-ocean overturning, and highlight the role of DWBCs as hot spots of dianeutral upwelling.},

The dynamics are based on the steady, planetary-geostrophic, shallow-water equations, including a linear bottom friction and a uniform diapycnal upwelling through the top of the model layer.The model solutions are broadly consistent with observations of the distribution and transport of AABW. The flows occur predominantly along potential vorticity contours, which are in turn broadly oriented along bathymetric contours. The characteristic weak flow across potential vorticity contours of the Stommel\{ndash\}Arons model is present as a small addition to this stronger forced mode along potential vorticity contours. As a consequence, mass balance is maintained not by hypothesized western boundary currents as in the Stommel\{ndash\}Arons model, but by the interplay between topographic slope currents and interior recirculations. In particular, a transposition is found in the flow of AABW from the western side of the Brazil Basin south of the equator to the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge north of the equator. This is also consistent with an analytical result derived by extending the Parsons mechanism to an abyssal layer overlying arbitrary bathymetry. The authors suggest that the results provide a more convincing zero-order picture than the Stommel\{ndash\}Arons model for the circulation of AABW and perhaps for abyssal water masses in general.},

We investigate these currents using a shallow water model that includes both the locally vertical and locally horizontal components of the Earth's rotation vector, thus accounting for the complete Coriolis force. We therefore avoid making the so-called " traditional approximation" that retains only the part of the Coriolis force associated with the locally vertical component of the rotation vector. Including the complete Coriolis force contributes an additional term to the fluid's potential vorticity, which may partially balance the change in sign of f as fluid crosses the equator over suitably shaped bathymetry.We focus on the Antarctic Bottom Water, which crosses the equator northwards in the western Atlantic ocean where the local bathymetry forms an almost-zonal channel. We show that this bathymetry facilitates the current's equatorial crossing via the action of the " non-traditional" component of the Coriolis force. We illustrate this process using both analytical and numerical solutions for flow of an abyssal current over idealised equatorial topography. We also consider the one-dimensional geostrophic adjustment of a body of fluid across the equator, and show that the " non-traditional" contribution to the fluid's angular momentum permits a larger cross-equatorial transport. These results underline the importance of including the complete Coriolis force in studies of the equatorial ocean, particularly in the weakly-stratified abyssal ocean where the non-traditional component is most pronounced. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The component of the Coriolis force due to the locally horizontal component of the Earth's rotation vector is commonly neglected, under the so-called traditional approximation. We investigate the role of this " non-traditional" component of the Coriolis force in cross-equatorial flow of abyssal ocean currents. We focus on the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), which crosses from the southern to the northern hemisphere through the Ceara abyssal plain in the western Atlantic ocean. The bathymetry in this region resembles a northwestward channel, connecting the Brazil Basin in the south to the Guyana Basin in the north. South of the equator, the AABW leans against the western continental rise, consistent with a northward flow in approximate geostrophic balance. The AABW then crosses to the other side of the abyssal channel as it crosses the equator, and flows into the northern hemisphere leaning towards the east against the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.The non-traditional component of the Coriolis force is strongest close to the equator. The traditional component vanishes at the equator, being proportional to the locally vertical component of the Earth's rotation vector. The weak stratification of the abyssal ocean, and subsequent small internal deformation radius, defines a relatively short characteristic horizontal lengthscale that tends to make non-traditional effects more prominent. Additionally, the steep gradients of the channel bathymetry induce large vertical velocities, which are linked to zonal accelerations by the non-traditional components of the Coriolis force. We therefore expect non-traditional effects to play a substantial role in cross-equatorial transport of the AABW.We present asymptotic steady solutions for non-traditional shallow water flow through an idealised abyssal channel, oriented at an oblique angle to the equator. The current enters from the south, leaning up against the western side of the channel in approximate geostrophic balance, and crosses the channel as it crosses the equator. The " non-traditional" contribution to the planetary angular momentum must be balanced by stronger westward flow in the channel, which leads to an increased transport in a northwestward channel, and a reduced transport in a northeastward channel. Our results suggest that as much as 10-30\% of the cross-equatorial flow of the AABW may be attributed to the non-traditional components of the Coriolis force. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract The results of Parts I and II are used to calculate the transports of heat and momentum that accompany growing baroclinic instabilities in Eady's model. The transports are calculated for both the conventional (``geostrophic'') kind of baroclinic instability and for symmetric instability, without any restriction on the stratification, as measured by the Richardson number. The transports are calculated consistently to second order in the amplitude expansion of stability theory, so that the transports are the sum of an eddy transport term and a mean transport term. The results show that both kinds of instability always transport heat upward and poleward, and always transport zonal momentum downward. Under geostrophic conditions the horizontal transport of zonal momentum depends on the horizontal shear of the basic flow. This shear is neglected in Eady's model so the horizontal momentum transports calculated here only contain the non-geostrophic contribution to the transport. The results show that this non-geostrophic transport is always equatorward for geostrophic instability, but for symmetric instability it may be either equatorward or poleward depending on the value of the Richardson number. It is suggested that the equatorward transport of zonal momentum by geostrophic instability is a more likely mechanism for Jupiter's equatorial acceleration than the transport by symmetric instability.},

  abstract = {The upper ocean large-scale circulation of the western tropical Atlantic from 11.5\textdegree S to the Caribbean in November and December 2000 is investigated from a new type of shipboard ADCP able to measure accurate velocities to 600 m depth, combined with lowered ADCP measurements. Satellite data and numerical model output complement the shipboard measurements to better describe the large-scale circulation. In November 2000 the North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC) was strongly intensified between 11 and 5\textdegree S by inflow from the east, hence the NBUC was formed further to the north than in the mean. The NBUC was transporting 23.1 Sv northward at 5\textdegree S, slightly less than the mean of six cruises (Geophysical Research Letters (2002) 29 (7) 1840). At 35\textdegree W the North Brazil Current (NBC) transported 29.4 Sv westward, less than the mean of 13 cruises (Geophysical Research Letters (2003) 30 (7) 1349). A strong retroflection ring had just pinched off the NBC retroflection according to the satellite information. The inflow into the Caribbean south of 16.5\textdegree N originated in part of a leakage from the NBC retroflection zone and in part from the North Equatorial Current. A thermocline intensified ring with a transport of about 30 Sv was located off Guadeloupe carrying South Atlantic Central Water towards the north. Observed deviations of the November/December 2000 flow field from the November long-term mean flow field were related to an enhanced Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) associated with an increased North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC), as well as to boundary current rings and Rossby waves with zonal wavelength of the order of 1000 km. At 44\textdegree W the presence of a Rossby wave associated with an anticyclonic circulation led to a strongly enhanced NBC of 65.0 Sv as well as to a combined NECC and Equatorial Undercurrent transport of 52.4 Sv, much stronger than during earlier cruises. While the 1/3\textdegree -FLAME model is unable to reproduce details of the vertical distribution of the observed horizontal flow at 44\textdegree W for November 2000 as well as the horizontal distribution of some of the observed permanent current bands, a climatological simulation with the 1/12\textdegree -FLAME agrees much better with the observations and provides information on the spreading path between the sections. E.g., the interpretation that the widening in the Antarctic Intermediate Water layer of the westward flowing NBC at 44\textdegree W in November was caused by water from the Equatorial Intermediate Current was further supported by the model results. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Large buoyancy loss driving deep convection is often associated with a large wind stress that is typically omitted in simulations of convection. Here it is shown that this omission is not justified when overturning occurs in a horizontally inhomogeneous ocean. In strongly baroclinic flows, convective mixing is influenced both by the background horizontal density gradient and by the across-front advection of buoyancy due to wind. The former process\textemdash known as slantwise convection\textemdash results in deeper convection, while the effect of wind depends on the relative orientation of wind with respect to the baroclinic front. For the case of the Labrador Sea, wintertime winds act to destabilize the baroclinic Labrador Current causing a buoyancy removal roughly one-third as large as the air\textendash sea buoyancy loss. Simulations using a nonhydrostatic numerical model, initialized and forced with observed fields from the Labrador Sea, show how the combination of wind and lateral gradients can result in significant convection within the current, in contrast with previous ideas. Though the advection of buoyancy due to wind in weakly baroclinic flows is negligible compared to the surface buoyancy removal typical of convective conditions, convective plumes are substantially deformed by wind. This deformation, and the associated across-front secondary circulation, are explained in terms of the vertical advection of wind-generated vorticity from the surface boundary layer to deeper depths. This mechanism generates vertical structure within the convective layer, contradicting the historical notion that properties become vertically homogenized during convection. For the interior Labrador Sea, this mechanism may be partly responsible for the vertical variability observed during convection, which modeling studies have until now failed to reproduce.},

The flow in the intermediate equatorial region is shown to accelerate and turn eastward, forming a narrow equatorial jet. The qualitative properties of the solution presented are consistent with the known dynamical characteristics of the deep western boundary currents as they flow from the midlatitudes into the tropics.

The initial state, chosen to approximate conditions in the surface ocean, consists of a weakly stratified mixed layer above a strongly stratified thermocline. Each layer has a uniform horizontal density gradient and a velocity field in thermal wind balance. The potential vorticity (PV) in the mixed layer is negative, indicating conditions favourable for symmetric instability. Once the instability reaches finite amplitude, a secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability forms. Linear theory accurately predicts the time and the wavenumber at which the secondary instability occurs. Following the secondary instability, small-scale turbulence injects positive PV into the mixed layer from the thermocline and from the upper boundary, resulting in a rapid equilibration of the flow as the PV is brought back to zero.

  abstract = {Abstract In this study, the influence of a geostrophically balanced horizontal density gradient on turbulent convection in the ocean is examined using numerical simulations and a theoretical scaling analysis. Starting with uniform horizontal and vertical buoyancy gradients, convection is driven by imposing a heat loss or a destabilizing wind stress at the upper boundary, and a turbulent layer soon develops. For weak lateral fronts, turbulent convection results in a nearly homogeneous mixed layer (ML) whose depth grows in time. For strong fronts, a turbulent layer develops, but this layer is not an ML in the traditional sense because it is characterized by persistent horizontal and vertical gradients in density. The turbulent layer is, however, nearly homogeneous in potential vorticity (PV), with a value near zero. Using the PV budget, a scaling for the depth of the turbulent low PV layer and its time dependence is derived that compares well with numerical simulations. Two dynamical regimes are identified. In a convective layer near the surface, turbulence is generated by the buoyancy loss at the surface; below this layer, turbulence is generated by a symmetric instability of the lateral density gradient. This work extends classical scalings for the depth of turbulent boundary layers to account for the ubiquitous presence of lateral density gradients in the ocean. The new results indicate that a lateral density gradient, in addition to the surface forcing, can affect the stratification and the rate of growth of the surface boundary layer.},

  abstract = {Many ocean fronts experience strong local atmospheric forcing by down-front winds, that is, winds blowing in the direction of the frontal jet. An analytic theory and nonhydrostatic numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the mechanism by which down-front winds lead to frontogenesis. When a wind blows down a front, cross-front advection of density by Ekman flow results in a destabilizing wind-driven buoyancy flux (WDBF) equal to the product of the Ekman transport with the surface lateral buoyancy gradient. Destabilization of the water column results in convection that is localized to the front and that has a buoyancy flux that is scaled by the WDBF. Mixing of buoyancy by convection, and Ekman pumping/suction resulting from the cross-front contrast in vertical vorticity of the frontal jet, drive frontogenetic ageostrophic secondary circulations (ASCs). For mixed layers with negative potential vorticity, the most frontogenetic ASCs select a preferred cross-front width and do not translate with the Ekman transport, but instead remain stationary in space. Frontal intensification occurs within several inertial periods and is faster the stronger the wind stress. Vertical circulation is characterized by subduction on the dense side of the front and upwelling along the frontal interface and scales with the Ekman pumping and convective mixing of buoyancy. Cross-front sections of density, potential vorticity, and velocity at the subpolar front of the Japan/East Sea suggest that frontogenesis by down-front winds was active during cold-air outbreaks and could result in strong vertical circulation. \textcopyright{} 2005 American Meteorological Society.},

  abstract = {Analyses of wintertime surveys of the Gulf Stream (GS) conducted as part of the CLIvar MOde water Dynamic Experiment (CLIMODE) reveal that water with negative potential vorticity (PV) is commonly found within the surface boundary layer (SBL) of the current. The lowest values of PV are found within the North Wall of the GS on the isopycnal layer occupied by Eighteen Degree Water, suggesting that processes within the GS may contribute to the formation of this low-PV water mass. In spite of large heat loss, the generation of negative PV was primarily attributable to cross-front advection of dense water over light by Ekman flow driven by winds with a down-front component. Beneath a critical depth, the SBL was stably stratified yet the PV remained negative due to the strong baroclinicity of the current, suggesting that the flow was symmetrically unstable. A large eddy simulation configured with forcing and flow parameters based on the observations confirms that the observed structure of the SBL is consistent with the dynamics of symmetric instability (SI) forced by wind and surface cooling. The simulation shows that both strong turbulence and vertical gradients in density, momentum, and tracers coexist in the SBL of symmetrically unstable fronts.SI is a shear instability that draws its energy from geostrophic flows. A parameterization for the rate of kinetic energy (KE) extraction by SI applied to the observations suggests that SI could result in a net dissipation of 33mWm-2 and 1mWm-2 for surveys with strong and weak fronts, respectively. The surveys also showed signs of baroclinic instability (BCI) in the SBL, namely thermally direct vertical circulations that advect biomass and PV. The vertical circulation was inferred using the omega equation and used to estimate the rate of release of available potential energy (APE) by BCI. The rate of APE release was found to be comparable in magnitude to the net dissipation associated with SI. This result points to an energy pathway where the GS's reservoir of APE is drained by BCI, converted to KE, and then dissipated by SI and its secondary instabilities. Similar dynamics are likely to be found at other strong fronts forced by winds and/or cooling and could play an important role in the energy balance of the ocean circulation. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {What is the ultimate state of a region of the atmosphere which is initially unstable to two-dimensional symmetric disturbances? The two initial states used are a region of uniform negative potential vorticity (PV), confined by two horizontal surfaces with either periodic conditions or walls at the vertical boundaries, and second, a larger domain of positive PV with an embedded zone of negative PV remote from the boundaries. The results show that the PV (and hence the instability) evolves due to boundary fluxes and internal dissipation in a way which can be simply deduced by consideration of the form of the PV generation terms. This evolution can be counterintuitive; for example, no-slip thermally conducting boundaries which imply boundary momentum and heat fluxes cannot change the volume-average PV. An important conclusion is that a parameterization of subgridscale turbulence that allows heat and momentum to flow down their mean gradients does not lead to down-gradient PV flux. The proposal is made that a parameterization of down-gradient PV flux has greater justification from a dynamical viewpoint. -from Authors},

Daily profiles of subinertial velocity, temperature, salinity, and neutral density are constructed for each mooring site and cross-line DWBC transport time series are derived for specified water mass layers. Time- averaged transports based on daily estimates of the flow and density fields in Stream coordinates are con- trasted with those derived from the Eulerian-mean flow field, modes of DWBC transport variability are inves- tigated through compositing, and comparisons are made to transport estimates for other latitudes. Integrating the daily velocity estimates over the neutral density range of 27.8\textendash 28.125 kg/m\^3 (encompassing Labrador Sea and Overflow Water layers), a mean equatorward DWBC transport of 22.8x10\^6+/-1.9x10\^6 m\^3/s is obtained. Notably, a statistically significant trend of decreasing equatorward transport is observed in several of the DWBC components as well as the current as a whole. The largest linear change (a 4\% decrease per year) is seen in the layer of Labrador Sea Water that was renewed by deep convection in the early 1990s whose transport fell from 9.0x10\^6 m\^3/s at the beginning of the field program to 5.8x10\^6m\^3/s at its end. The corresponding linear fit to the combined Labrador Sea and Overflow Water DWBC transport decreases from 26.4x10\^6 to 19.1x10\^6m\^3/s. In contrast, no long-term trend is observed in upper ocean Slope Water transport. These trends are discussed in the context of decadal observations of the North Atlan- tic circulation, and subpolar air-sea interaction/water mass transformation.},

  abstract = {Symmetric and asymmetric inertial instability of the westerly mid-latitude barotropic Bickley jet is analysed without the traditional approximation which neglects the vertical component of the Coriolis force, as well as the contribution of the vertical velocity to the latter. A detailed linear stability analysis of the jet at large Rossby numbers on the non-traditional \$f\$ -plane is performed for long waves in both the two-layer rotating shallow-water and continuously stratified Boussinesq models. The dependence of the instability on both the Rossby and Burger numbers of the jet is investigated and compared to the traditional case. It is shown that non-traditional effects significantly increase the growth rate of the instability at small enough Burger numbers (weak stratifications) for realistic aspect ratios of the jet. The main results are as follows. (i)~ Two-layer shallow-water model . In the parameter regimes where the jet is inertially stable on the traditional \$f\$ -plane, the symmetric inertial instability with respect to perturbations with zero along-jet wavenumber arises on the non-traditional \$f\$ -plane. Both non-traditional symmetric and asymmetric (small but non-zero wavenumbers) inertial instabilities have higher growth rates than their traditional counterparts. (ii)~ Continuously stratified model. It is shown that by a proper change of variables the linear stability problem for the barotropic jet, on the non-traditional \$f\$ -plane, can be rendered separable and analysed along the same lines as in the traditional approximation. Neutral, weak and strong background stratifications are considered. For the neutral stratification the jet is inertially unstable if the traditional approximation is relaxed, while its traditional counterpart is not. For a sufficiently weak stratification, both symmetric and asymmetric inertial instabilities have substantially higher growth rates than in the traditional approximation. The across-jet structure of non-traditional unstable modes is strikingly different, as compared to those under the traditional approximation. No discernible differences between the two approximations are observed for strong enough stratifications. The influence of dissipation and non-hydrostatic effects upon the instability is quantified.},

  abstract = {Abstract. With the increase in computational power, ocean models with kilometer-scale resolution have emerged over the last decade. These models have been used for quantifying the energetic exchanges between spatial scales, informing the design of eddy parametrizations, and preparing observing networks. The increase in resolution, however, has drastically increased the size of model outputs, making it difficult to transfer and analyze the data. It remains, nonetheless, of primary importance to assess more systematically the realism of these models. Here, we showcase a cloud-based analysis framework proposed by the Pangeo project that aims to tackle such distribution and analysis challenges. We analyze the output of eight submesoscale-permitting simulations, all on the cloud, for a crossover region of the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) altimeter mission near the Gulf Stream separation. The cloud-based analysis framework (i)~minimizes the cost of duplicating and storing ghost copies of data and (ii)~allows for seamless sharing of analysis results amongst collaborators. We describe the framework and provide example analyses (e.g., sea-surface height variability, submesoscale vertical buoyancy fluxes, and comparison to predictions from the mixed-layer instability parametrization). Basin- to global-scale, submesoscale-permitting models are still at their early stage of development; their cost and carbon footprints are also rather large. It would, therefore, benefit the community to document the different model configurations for future best practices. We also argue that an emphasis on data analysis strategies would be crucial for improving the models themselves.},

The flow in the lower layer preserves potential vorticity and Bernoulli function. The former includes the relative vorticity f the current and the latter includes the current's kinetic energy. The required relation between the potential vorticity and the Bernoulli function is determined by matching the solution far from the equator with the ventilated thermocline theory of Luyten et al. The model describes an eastward-accelerating undercurrent fed by a general wedge-shaped meridional circulation pattern. The general character of the meridional and zonal flow, as well as the magnitudes of the undercurrent velocity, the current width and thermocline depth agree reasonably well with observations.},

Below the surface, a strong temperature inversion (0.98~\textdegree C) was present within a barrier layer.

To establish this connection, we use data from altimetry and model output from several high resolution global models. A significant 40\textendash 70 day variability is found in the sea surface height in the North Brazil Current retroflection region with a propagation toward the Lesser Antilles. The frequency of variability is generated by intrinsic processes associated with the shedding of eddies, rather than by atmospheric forcing. This sea surface height variability is able to pass the Lesser Antilles, it propagates westward with the background ocean flow in the Caribbean Sea and finally affects the variability in the Yucatan Channel volume transport.}

The Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS) was used to simulate ocean circulation with 0.25\textdegree{} horizontal resolution and 32 vertical levels. Two numerical experiments were performed considering river discharge and river input. Temperature and salinity distributions obtained numerically were compared with Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) and in situ observations from the Prediction Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) buoys located at 38 \textdegree W8 \textdegree N and 38 \textdegree W12 \textdegree N. Surface currents were compared with Surface Currents from Diagnostic model (SCUD). Once we verified that model results agreed with observations, scenarios with and without river discharges were compared. The difference between both simulations in the Sea Surface Temperature distribution was smaller than 2 \textdegree C, whereas the Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) changed by approximately 8 psu in the plume area close to the coast from August to December and reaching SSS differences of approximately 4 psu in the region of the North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC). The surface current velocities are stronger in the experiment with river discharge, mainly in the NECC area from September to December and close to the coast in June to August. The results show that river discharges also cause a phase shift in the zonal currents, anticipating the retroflection of the North Brazil Current by two months and enhancing eastward NECC transport, which is in agreement with observations. The Mixed Layer Depth and Isothermal Layer Depth in the presence of river discharge is 20\textendash 50 m shallower over the entire extension of the Amazon plume compared with the situation without continental inflows. As a consequence, stronger Barrier Layers develop in the river plumes, reducing the Oceanic Heat Content in the WTNA.}

We produce a sea surface height field by mapping the Pathfinder collinear sea surface height anomaly data into a 0.25\textdegree{} \texttimes{} 0.25\textdegree{} -10 day resolution grid, adding at each grid point the annual mean dynamic topography relative to 1000 m, which is obtained from the high resolution (0.25\textdegree{} x 0.25\textdegree ) 1997 Boyer-Levitus climatology. This climatology is first filtered to conveniently preserve features at a 300 km scale. The circulation field offshore of the 1000 m isobath was obtained using a generalization of the standard geostrophic equation at each 10-day time step, which is shown to be valid also on the Equator. Comparisons of the altimeter-derived fields are made against data from PIRATA moorings, CTD and ADCP WOCE Etambot cruise data spanning the Equator. It is shown that the currents derived from surface data correlate better with the ADCP-measured subsurface rather than to surface currents. The time evolution of annual and interannual patterns of the circulation field are obtained by separating the velocity component time series into period bands with a combination of EOF and Multichannel Singular Spectrum Analysis. A double-cored North Equatorial Contercurrent (NECC) is seen in August-September, with the southern branch related to the North Brazil Current (NBC) retroflection, while the northern branch is related to northern hemisphere westward flows turning to the southeast. The NECC main core at 5\textdegree N presents a meandering pattern west of 30\textdegree W which slowly propagates westward at a speed of 1.8 km/day. The north branch of the South Equatorial Current (SEC) only appears after July, recirculating water into a meandering EUC. An annual equatorial standing wave pattern confined to 3\textdegree N-3\textdegree S has been detected possibly being the cause of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) meanders and the appearance of open ocean windows for leakage of south Atlantic waters into the north Atlantic and vice-versa. The variability between 5\textdegree S-15\textdegree S is mostly in the interannual band with a very weak annual cycle. The estimation of the mean and interannual variability of the geostrophic meridional transports across 3\textdegree N and 3\textdegree S revealed an absolute maximum northward transport of 20 Sv at 3\textdegree S during January-March 1997, and a relative maximum southward transport of 10 Sv at 3\textdegree N centered in June of the same year. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {In this study, we investigate the sensitivity of the equatorial circulation simulated with the high-resolution World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Community Modeling Effort (CME) model to the specification of eddy viscosity. In one of two simulations the coefficient of vertical viscosity is tripled. We focus on the dynamics associated with the anomalous eastward surface flow found in the simulation results. We find, in agreement with other studies, that close to the western boundary, the equatorial undercurrent is dominated by a large positive pressure gradient. In the top layer, for the low-viscosity case, the balance in the western part of the basin is everywhere between the horizontal pressure gradient and vertical viscosity with the advective terms playing a secondary role. In the high-viscosity zonal momentum budget analysis the advective terms are less significant in the surface layers in the west. Toward the east the advective terms become more important in the low-viscosity experiment, whereas in the high-viscosity case the balance is still predominantly between the horizontal pressure gradient and vertical diffusion terms. It is found that in the CME, horizontal viscosity plays a very minor role in the zonal momentum balance. Changes in the vertical viscosity lead to changes in the nonlinear advective terms. These, in turn, contribute to the unusual eastward surface flow. Copyright 1999 by the American Geophysical Union.},

The role of mesoscale eddies in transporting Agulhas leakage is investigated using a recent technique from nonlinear dynamical systems theory applied on geostrophic currents inferred from the over two decade long satellite altimetry record. Eddies are found to acquire material coherence away from the Agulhas retroflection, near the Walvis Ridge in the South Atlantic. Yearly, one to four coherent material eddies are detected with diameters ranging from 40 to 280 km. A total of 23 eddy cores of about 50 km in diameter and with at least 30\% of their contents traceable into the Indian Ocean were found to travel across the subtropical gyre with minor filamentation. Only one eddy core was found to pour its contents on the North Brazil Current. While the ability of eddies to carry Agulhas leakage northwestward across the South Atlantic is supported by our analysis, this is more restricted than suggested by earlier ring transport assessments.}

  abstract = {The notion that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) can have more than one stable equilibrium emerged in the 1980s as a powerful hypothesis to explain rapid climate variability during the Pleistocene. Ever since, the idea that a temporary perturbation of the AMOC\textemdash or a permanent change in its forcing\textemdash could trigger an irreversible collapse has remained a reason for concern. Here we review literature on the equilibrium stability of the AMOC and present a synthesis that puts our understanding of past and future AMOC behavior in a unifying framework. This framework is based on concepts from Dynamical Systems Theory, which has proven to be an important tool in interpreting a wide range of model behavior. We conclude that it cannot be ruled out that the AMOC in our current climate is in, or close to, a regime of multiple equilibria. But there is considerable uncertainty in the location of stability thresholds with respect to our current climate state, so we have no credible indications of where our present-day AMOC is located with respect to thresholds. We conclude by identifying gaps in our knowledge and proposing possible ways forward to address these gaps.},

When this Ekman transport is down the slope it causes convective mixing\textemdash much like a downfront wind in the surface boundary layer\textemdash destroying stratification and potential vorticity. In this manuscript we show how this can lead to the development of a forced centrifugal or symmetric instability regime, where the potential vorticity flux generated by friction along the boundary is balanced by submesoscale instabilities that return the boundary layer potential vorticity to zero. This balance provides a strong constraint on the boundary layer evolution, which we use to develop a theory that explains the evolution of the boundary layer thickness, the rate at which the instabilities extract energy from the geostrophic flow field, and the magnitude and vertical structure of the dissipation. Finally, we show using theory and a high-resolution numerical model how the presence of centrifugal or symmetric instabilities alters the time-dependent Ekman adjustment of the boundary layer, delaying Ekman buoyancy arrest and enhancing the total energy removed from the balanced flow field. Submesoscale instabilities of the bottom boundary layer may therefore play an important, largely overlooked, role in the energetics of flow over topography in the ocean.},

The Amazon Fan and Ceara Rise in the western equatorial Atlantic Ocean lie directly in the flowpath of the North Brazil Current (NBC) which, as a conduit for the cross-equatorial transport of heat and salinity, is a key component for the heat budget of the North Atlantic. Mg/Ca palaeothermometry and stable oxygen isotope analysis of planktonic foraminifera sampled from 15 sites across the Amazon Fan and Ceara Rise reveal variations in oceanic surface currents and of the dispersal of freshwater from the River Amazon over five timeslices (modern; early Holocene; Younger Dryas; Late Glacial and Marine Isotope Stage 3). Sea surface temperature reconstructions reveal progressive climatic amelioration over the last \textasciitilde 30ka, indicating a temperature increase of \textasciitilde 3.2{$\pm$}1.1\textdegree C since the Late Glacial. In conjunction with this warming, values of {$\delta\delta$}18O, a proxy for water column stratification indicates increased vertical mixing of the glacial ocean. The spatial distribution of values of {$\delta$}18w (the isotopic composition of ambient seawater) is used to infer surface current variations and demonstrates an oceanward shift in the river outflow plume in cold climates representing a prolongation or possibly permanent continuation in the duration of the seasonal retroflection of the NBC causing the curtailment of cross-equatorial transport. A prolongation of this retroflection could have resulted from a mean southward migration of the southern boundary of the ITCZ. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.}

Thermohaline stratification and buoyancy forcing are based on data from the Eurasian basin of the Arctic Ocean, where overflows are particularly crucial to the exchange of dense water between shelves and deep basins, yet have been studied relatively little. A nonlinear equation of state is used, allowing proper representation of thermohaline structure and mixing. We examine three increasingly complex scenarios: nonrotating 2D, rotating 2D, and rotating 3D. The nonrotating 2D case behaves according to known theory: the gravity current descends alongslope until reaching a relatively shallow neutral buoyancy level. However, in the rotating cases, we have identified novel dynamics: in both 2D and 3D, the submesoscale range is dominated by symmetric instability (SI). Rotation leads to geostrophic adjustment, causing dense water to be confined within the forcing region longer and attain a greater density anomaly. In the 2D case, Ekman drainage leads to descent of the geostrophic jet, forming a highly dense alongslope front. Beams of negative Ertel potential vorticity develop parallel to the slope, initiating SI and vigorous mixing in the overflow. In 3D, baroclinic eddies are responsible for cross-isobath dense water transport, but SI again develops along the slope and at eddy edges. Remarkably, through two different dynamics, the 2D SI-dominated case and 3D eddy-dominated case attain roughly the same final water mass distribution, highlighting the potential role of SI in driving mixing within certain regimes of dense overflows.},

SI may contribute to water mass modification and mesoscale energy dissipation in flow systems throughout the World Ocean. Dense gravity currents forced by surface buoyancy loss over shallow shelves are a particularly compelling test case, as they are characterized by density fronts and shears susceptible to a wide range of submesoscale instabilities. We present idealized experiments of Arctic shelf overflows employing the GFDL-MOM6 in z* and isopycnal coordinates. At the highest resolutions, the dense flow undergoes geostrophic adjustment and forms bottom- and surface-intensified jets. The density front along the topography combined with geostrophic shear initiates SI, leading to onset of secondary shear instability, dissipation of geostrophic energy, and turbulent mixing. We explore the impact of vertical coordinate, resolution, and parameterization of shear-driven mixing on the representation of water mass transformation. We find that in isopycnal and low-resolution z* simulations, limited vertical resolution leads to inadequate representation of diapycnal mixing. This motivates our development of a parameterization for SI-driven turbulence. The parameterization is based on identifying unstable regions through a balanced Richardson number criterion and slumping isopycnals toward a balanced state. The potential energy extracted from the large-scale flow is assumed to correspond to the kinetic energy of SI which is dissipated through shear mixing. Parameterizing submesoscale instabilities by combining isopycnal slumping with diapycnal mixing becomes crucial as ocean models move toward resolving mesoscale eddies and fronts but not the submesoscale phenomena they host.},

At these locations, the linear negative relationships between SMOS SSS and OSTIA SST signals vary from -0.20C-1 to -0.25C-1, which are comparable to the ones obtained from TAO. From June to December 2010, the largest TIW signals and meridional gradients of both SSS and SST appear around 2N west of 100W. They shift southward and cross the equator at 90W. In addition to the large negative correlation band around 2N, a band of negative correlations between SSS and SST signals also exists around 8N west of 110W for the 33 day signals. The peak amplitude of the 33 day SMOS SSS signals west of 135W is reduced by {$>$}40\% with respect to values east of 135W, while the reduction for SST is much lower ({$<$}20\%). The amplitudes and longitudinal extents of TIW signals and the dominant westward propagation speed of 17 day TIWs (as detected by SMOS and Aquarius) at the equator decrease from 2010 to 2013 associated with the transition from a strong La Ni\~na to non-La Ni\~na conditions.},

Analysis of the observations suggests that the front is forced by downfront winds and undergoes symmetric instability, resulting in elevated upper-ocean kinetic energy, restratification, and turbulent dissipation. The instability is triggered as downfront winds act on weak upper-ocean vertical stratification and strong lateral stratification produced by mesoscale frontogenesis. The instability's estimated rate of kinetic energy extraction from the front accounts for the difference between the measured rate of turbulent dissipation and the predicted contribution from one-dimensional scalings of buoyancy- and wind-driven turbulence, indicating that the instability underpins the enhanced dissipation. These results provide direct evidence of the occurrence of symmetric instability in a quiescent open-ocean environment and highlight the need to represent the instability's restratification and dissipative effects in climate-scale ocean models.},

A PV budget framework is applied to quantitatively document the competing physical processes responsible for deepening and shoaling the mixed layer. The observations reveal a distinct seasonal cycle in upper-ocean PV, characterized by frequent occurrences of negative PV within deep (up to about 350 m) mixed layers from winter to mid-spring, and positive PV beneath shallow (mostly less than 50 m) mixed layers during the remainder of the year. The cumulative positive and negative subinertial changes in the mixed layer depth, which are largely unaccounted for by advective contributions, exceed the deepest mixed layer by one order of magnitude, suggesting that mixed layer depth is shaped by the competing effects of destratifying and restratifying processes. Deep mixed layers are attributed to persistent atmospheric cooling from winter to mid-spring, which triggers gravitational instability leading to mixed layer deepening. However, on shorter time scales of days, conditions favorable to symmetric instability often occur as winds intermittently align with transient frontal flows. The ensuing submesoscale frontal instabilities are found to fundamentally alter upper-ocean turbulent convection, and limit the deepening of the mixed layer in the winter-to-mid-spring period. These results emphasize the key role of submesoscale frontal instabilities in determining the seasonal evolution of the mixed layer in the open ocean.},

We then give a non-perturbative proof of existence and uniqueness of the adjusted state, again for configurations with non- negative initial potential vorticities. We prove that wave trapping is impossible within this adjusted state and, hence, adjustment is always complete for small enough departures from balance. However, we show that retarded adjustment occurs if the adjusted state admits quasi-stationary states decaying via tunnelling across a potential barrier. A description of finite-amplitude periodic nonlinear waves known to exist in configurations with constant potential vorticity in this model is given in terms of Lagrangian variables. Finally, shock formation is analysed and semi-quantitative criteria based on the values of initial gradients and the relative vorticity of initial states are established for wave breaking showing, again, essential differences between the regions of positive and negative vorticity. 1.},

Instabilities of jets are investigated by direct pseudospectral collocation method in various flow configurations, starting from the classical barotropic and baroclinic instabilities. Characteristic features of instabilities are displayed, as well as typical patterns of their nonlinear saturation. It is shown that in the Phillips model of Chapter 5, new ageostrophic Rossby\textendash Kelvin and shear instabilities appear at finite Rossby numbers. These instabilities are interpreted in terms of resonances among waves counter-propagating in the flow. It is demonstrated that the classical inertial instability is a specific case of ageostrophic baroclinic instability. At the equator it appears also in the barotropic configuration, and is related to resonances of Yanai waves. The nature of the inertial instability in terms of trapped modes is established. A variety of instabilities of density fronts is displayed.},

The influence of these "non-traditional" terms is different for flows with positive and negative horizontal relative vorticities. A critical value of the Richardson number appears in the second case, with the instability changing its character across it. Major differences appear between hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic versions of the instability. All these features are absent in the traditional approximation.},

Using GFDL's newly developed global coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere model (CM2.0), the global response to a sustained addition of freshwater to the model's North Atlantic is simulated. This freshwater forcing substantially weakens the Atlantic THC, resulting in a southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone over the Atlantic and Pacific, an El Ni\~no\textendash like pattern in the southeastern tropical Pacific, and weakened Indian and Asian summer monsoons through air\textendash sea interactions.},

  abstract = {The North Brazil Current (NBC) connects the North and South Atlantic and is the major pathway for the surface return flow of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Here, we calculate the NBC geostrophic transport time series based on 5 decades of observations near the western boundary off the coast of Brazil. Results reveal a multidecadal NBC variability that lags Labrador Sea deep convection by a few years. The NBC transport time series is coherent with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation in sea surface temperature, which also has been widely linked to AMOC fluctuations in previous modeling studies. Our results thus suggest that the observed multidecadal NBC transport variability is a useful indicator for AMOC variations. The suggested connection between the NBC and AMOC is assessed in a 700 year control simulation of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's CM2.1 coupled climate model. The model results are in agreement with observations and further demonstrate that the variability of NBC transport is a good index for tracking AMOC variations. Concerning the debate about whether a slowdown of AMOC has already occurred under global warming, the observed NBC transport time series suggests strong multidecadal variability but no significant trend.},

  abstract = {By synthesizing recent studies employing a wide range of approaches (modern observations, paleo reconstructions, and climate model simulations), this paper provides a comprehensive review of the linkage between multidecadal Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) variability and Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) and associated climate impacts. There is strong observational and modeling evidence that multidecadal AMOC variability is a crucial driver of the observed AMV and associated climate impacts and an important source of enhanced decadal predictability and prediction skill. The AMOC-AMV linkage is consistent with observed key elements of AMV. Furthermore, this synthesis also points to a leading role of the AMOC in a range of AMV-related climate phenomena having enormous societal and economic implications, for example, Intertropical Convergence Zone shifts; Sahel and Indian monsoons; Atlantic hurricanes; El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation; Pacific Decadal Variability; North Atlantic Oscillation; climate over Europe, North America, and Asia; Arctic sea ice and surface air temperature; and hemispheric-scale surface temperature. Paleoclimate evidence indicates that a similar linkage between multidecadal AMOC variability and AMV and many associated climate impacts may also have existed in the preindustrial era, that AMV has enhanced multidecadal power significantly above a red noise background, and that AMV is not primarily driven by external forcing. The role of the AMOC in AMV and associated climate impacts has been underestimated in most state-of-the-art climate models, posing significant challenges but also great opportunities for substantial future improvements in understanding and predicting AMV and associated climate impacts.},

  abstract = {Both the North Brazil Current (NBC) and the Brazil Current (BC) are western boundary currents (WBCs) that separate from the western Atlantic coast. The NBC retroflects and sheds several rings per year (at the retroflection region), whereas the BC rarely sheds rings near its separation point. Traditionally, the difference between these two WBCs has been attributed to the Malvinas Current (MC), whose momentum flux opposes the poleward momentum flux of the BC, thus preventing rings shedding at the point where the current leaves the coast. Even in the absence of the MC, rings from the separating BC would have never been regularly generated because of the relatively large slant of the coastline relative to the zonal direction. Using the recently proposed theory of Zharkov and Nof, it is demonstrated that the large inclination of the coastline between 20\textdegree{} and 45\textdegree S (approximately 50\textdegree ) lies within the regime that does not allow the BC a continuous shedding of rings. In contrast, the inclination of the coastline between 5\textdegree{} and 8\textdegree N is sufficiently small to allow the NBC a continuous and smooth shedding of rings. The importance of the coastline inclination comes about through a ring {$\beta$}-induced westward propagation rate. In the small inclination case, the alongshore migration is fast, allowing the newly formed rings to quickly escape from their generation zone (i.e., before they are recaptured by the newly born rings generated behind). In contrast, in the high inclination case, the alongshore speed is so small that the rings spend a long time in the generation area and, consequently, are usually recaptured by the new rings generated just behind them. The authors argue, paradoxically, that the rings occasionally shed by the BC are probably due to the MC that advects the rings away from the generation area, preventing their recapture by the current behind them. Although no new analytical solutions are presented, the authors elaborate on the application of the recapturing condition to the NBC and BC and show new numerical simulations for both the NBC and the BC. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

To date, symmetric instability has only been recognized to occur at the ocean surface or near topographic boundary layers. Analyses of direct microstructure measurements reveal enhanced dissipation caused by symmetric instability in the northwestern equatorial Pacific thermocline, which provides the first observational evidence of subsurface symmetric instability away from boundaries. Enhanced subsurface cross-equatorial exchange provides the negative potential vorticity needed to drive the symmetric instability, which is well reproduced by numerical modeling. These results suggest a new route to energy dissipation for large scale currents, and hence a new ocean turbulent mixing process in the ocean interior. Given the importance of vertical mixing in the evolution of equatorial thermocline, models may need to account for this mechanism to produce more reliable climate projections.},

  abstract = {The thermohaline streamfunction is presented. The thermohaline streamfunction is the integral of transport in temperature-salinity space and represents the net pathway of oceanic water parcels in that space. The thermohaline streamfunction is proposed as a diagnostic to understand the global oceanic circulation and its role in the global movement of heat and freshwater. The coordinate system used filters out adiabatic fluctuations. Physical pathways and ventilation time scales are naturally diagnosed, as are the roles of the mean flow and turbulent fluctuations. Because potential density is a function of temperature and salinity, the framework is naturally isopycnal and is ideal for the diagnosis of water-mass transformations and advective diapycnal heat and freshwater transports. Crucially, the thermohaline streamfunction is computationally and practically trivial to implement as a diagnostic for ocean models. Here, the thermohaline streamfunction is computed using the output of an equilibrated intermediate complexity climate model. It describes a global cell, a warm tropical cell, and a bottom water cell. The streamfunction computed from eddy-induced advection is equivalent in magnitude to that from the total advection, demonstrating the leading-order importance of parameterized eddy fluxes in oceanic heat and freshwater transports. The global cell, being clockwise in thermohaline space, tends to advect both heat and salt toward denser (poleward) water masses in symmetry with the atmosphere's poleward transport of moisture. A reprojection of the global cell from thermohaline to geographical coordinates reveals a thermohaline circulation reminiscent of the schematized "global conveyor." \textcopyright{} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},
